            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32545:4"/>
                  <p>And therefore before I proceed farther, it will be neceſſary to deliver you from thoſe thoughts, and perhaps that fear. For though the miſchiefs in the one, and Bleſſings in the other be ſuch, as deſerve never to be forgotten; yet poſſibly may not endure a perpetual importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Remembrancer.</p>
                  <p>And the truth is, the very words and phraſe of the text, which only at the firſt bluſh carries us upon thoſe thoughts, will leave us, if we look a little nearer to them. For the Straying here will prove to be of another kind, and the Return will be found to be to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop. The ſtraying here was of ſuch as had err'd like <hi>Sheep,</hi> whereas ours had little or nothing of the Sheep in it, ſave the Sheeps clothing; for dreſſ'd up they were with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes as ſoft as wool, <hi>Gods glory, Purity</hi> of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Chriſtian liberty,</hi> nothing worſe then theſe, and ſo indeed they err'd like Sheep, as if they had been ſuch; but the truth is, it was liker the ranging of Wolves, tearing and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then the ſtraying of weak and ſilly Sheep. And for the returning likewiſe here, though it was to a Biſhop, yet I dare not be ſo bold with him that bears that name in the text, directly to apply it to our Biſhops, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our return to this.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:32545:4"/>
                  <p>The Biſhop here was no doubt our bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> and Saviour, whom God himſelf had conſecrated and ordained to that office; but our Biſhops are not otherwiſe concerned here then as they can make their title from and under him; but if that may be done hereafter, I truſt you will not be againſt it. In the mean time, if there were no more in it, me thinks this ſhould be enough to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to the name of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which our Saviour himſelf hath vouchſafed to take upon him. But having laid aſide that argument, which the words at firſt ſight ſeem'd to offer, I beſpeak your attention to one of a more common intereſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all that would be Chriſtians, whoſe character it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who from the ways of ſin and error, are return'd to the faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who to reduce us from thoſe ways hath taken upon him to be our Shepherd and Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>The main point is, <hi>That God of his mercy complying with the neceſsities and infirmities of nature, hath erected an</hi> Office <hi>of truſt and confidence in his Church, under the quality of a Shepherd and Biſhop, to direct and guide us, who otherwiſe would erre and ſtray like ſheep, and ſo be loſt for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:32545:5"/>
                  <p>THe particulars incident to this are, <hi>firſt.</hi> The <hi>neceſsity</hi> of it, impli'd in our <hi>natural condition,</hi> who like Sheep are of themſelves apt to erre and go aſtray. 2. The <hi>accommodation</hi> we have for it. For what ſhould they do which are out of the way, but return? and to whom ſhould Sheep return but to a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd? and loſt Sheep, but to him that came <hi>to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt?</hi> and where ſhould they find ſo ſafe and ſure a retreat, as in him who purchas'd them with his own blood? All theſe are accompliſhed in our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom we ſhall conſider, firſt in his <hi>office</hi> of Shepherd or Biſhop; then in his Flock or <hi>Dioceſs;</hi> the Souls of men. <hi>We are returned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THe firſt thing we meet with in the text, is our <hi>natural condition.</hi> That we were as Sheep that had gone aſtray. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this is the firſt thing we meet with in our Liturgy. <hi>We have erred and ſtray'd like loſt Sheep.</hi> And though it were fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it ſhould be there, for, ſure I am, we never err'd worſe then ſince we laid that by; yet here we look upon it in another relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and uſe; it is the firſt ſtone to be laid in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32545:5"/>this building, in the erection of the office of a Shepherd and Biſhop. The infirmities of the Sheep are the ground of the neceſſity of a Shepherd.</p>
                  <p>But now that while we are ſpeaking of our errors, we do not commit one, we muſt know, firſt what <hi>kind</hi> of erring this is, and then how we fell into the fatal neceſſity of it. What it is, the Biſhop that muſt lead us out of it, will tell us; for he is the Biſhop of our ſouls: and therefore our Straying here muſt be that of the Soul. For though our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral infirmities do expoſe us to error in many things elſe, yea almoſt in all other things, even thoſe that are within the reach of ſenſe and reaſon: there is not any thing in <hi>Nature,</hi> in <hi>Art,</hi> in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> though commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for truth, which of late time is not charged with error, and it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not without cauſe; yet without any great regard here, if the Soul be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>
                  <p>Now if we be ſo liable to error in the things of this life, where both the end and the way to them are within the compaſs of the eye, in which we erre, as it were, in our own Countrey, where we are bred and born; we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32545:6"/>muſt certainly loſe our way, where we are ſtrangers, being Citizens of another Countrey, as thoſe bleſſed Saints, who beſt knew the ways of the ſoul, confeſſed, that they were <hi>ſtrangers and pilgrims</hi> here. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.14. And <hi>they which ſay ſo, ſhew plainly that they ſeek a Countrey,</hi> and <hi>that a better, that is, a heavenly,</hi> where <hi>God hath prepared for them a City.</hi> They muſt needs be diſappointed that ſeek for Heaven upon earth, where there is nothing fitted and proportion'd to the Soul, either for the <hi>nature</hi> or the <hi>deſires</hi> of it. The Soul is immortal, and cannot be provided for, where all things are liable to change and mortality; for when it ſhall ſurvive them, it will be at a loſs, till it find a Countrey like it ſelf, that is everlaſting and immortal.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>nature,</hi> ſo the <hi>deſires</hi> of the Soul are unſatisfied here; the eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the ear with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the underſtanding with knowledg, nor the heart with the beſt and choiceſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of it. We are ſoon wearied and tir'd with what we have, and are as thirſty of that we have not. In our plenty as craving, as others in their greateſt wants. The goods of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32545:6"/>this world are Hydropick all, <hi>quo plus bibuntur plus ſitiuntur.</hi> They that have the greateſt ſhare and portion in them, of Wealth, of Honour, of Power, do not ſleep the better, nor are their bodies leſs comber'd with diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor their minds freer from vexations and troubles. And therefore as the Saints I nam'd before, did by what they willingly ſuffer'd here, ſhew plainly that they ſought another Countrey; ſo by this is ſhewn as plainly, that they had cauſe to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>Now here lies the fatal neceſſity of erring, they ſeek a Countrey and City that is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unknown to nature, either what the <hi>ſtate</hi> of that Countrey is, or by what <hi>laws</hi> the Citizens thereof are to be govern'd. And when we walk in the dark it is not ſtrange we ſhould loſe our way.</p>
                  <p>A chief part of that way lies, <hi>firſt</hi> in the knowledg and <hi>worſhip</hi> of that God, who had prepar'd for them a City, by what Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, Rites and Ceremonies he will be ſerv'd. How much of that may be had by <hi>nature,</hi> we learn by thoſe, who were moſt likely to know, but did not, who were the maſters of knowledge to moſt other Nations,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> for of ſuch S. <hi>Paaul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. Who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32545:7"/>when they profeſſ'd themſelves to be wiſe, as well they might in many other things, yet in this of Gods worſhip, they became fools. For they <hi>turned the glory of the uncorruptible God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.23.</note> 
                     <hi>into the ſimilitude and image of corruptible Man, and of birds, and four footed beaſts, and of creeping things.</hi>

                  <p>By this we may ſee the neceſſity we have of Leading; let us now ſee the <hi>accommodation</hi> we have for it in the Leader. Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, a perſon every way fitted for the purpoſe, both for his skill, and good will; He knew beſt the Heavenly Countrey, whither we are going, and the way to it; for he came from thence, from the boſom of his Father. And for his good will to his own, we cannot doubt they are the Sheep which he had purchaſed with his blood, and by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32545:8"/>that had a juſt title to govern in what Lordly way of Secular domination he pleaſed; yet choſe that eaſie gentle way as Shepherds uſe to lead their Sheep. And ſuch he profeſſed himſelf to be.<note place="margin">John 10.11.</note> 
                     <hi>I am the good Shepherd: the good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep,</hi> and He made it good in every point while he was upon carth; He went about doing good, preaching the Goſpel, healing the diſeaſes of the Sheep, forgiving their ſins, till he came to the laſt and hardeſt work of a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, He laid down his life for his Sheep.</p>
                  <p>Yet his Paſtoral care died not with him. As he was a Prieſt for ever; ſo he was a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd for ever; for after he had in perſon aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven, he took care for his flock that he left behind Him, that they might not be as Sheep without a Shepherd.

Yes, to all that can rightly claim from Him.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20</note> His promiſe was to be with them to the end of the world, that is, longer then any Apoſtle could live. I am ſure the neceſſities of the Sheep will be the ſame for ever; for Sheep we ſhall be ſtill whereſoever we are.

                     <hi>ad conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationem Sanctorum, &amp; adificationem corporis Chriſti;</hi> that is, ſo long as there ſhould be Saints to be perfected, and ſo long as Chriſt ſhould have a Church, a body upon earth, and that is ſo long as there ſhould be Sheep Chriſt had provided there ſhould be Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. And theſe he hath taken to that near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conjunction, that the obedience or contempt done to them, he takes it as done to himſelf. <hi>Qui vos audit me audit, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The benefits and advantages we have by this are many; firſt, it is an <hi>honour</hi> and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Shepherds, that the work they do is Chriſts, who will bear them out in what they do according to their duty,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32545:10"/>and reward them for what they ſuffer for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It removes all <hi>diſcouragement</hi> from the Sheep, that make a ſtand at the infirmities and frailties of their Shepherds, that they look through and beyond all them at the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Chriſt under whom they ſerve.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another great benefit it is, that in all doubtful and <hi>difficult</hi> caſes we may ſecure our ſelves upon the conduct of Chriſt in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. For if poſſibly men ſhould be miſled by them into error, when in ſimplicity of heart, not knowing any thing to the contrary, they ſhall ſubmit to them; I dare promiſe them at leaſt a favourable hearing from him that commanded the obedience.</p>
                  <p>But I dare not, nor can ſay that for all Shepherds; for every congregational herd hath their Shepherd too; but ſuch as have no part in that power, which is derived from Chriſt and his miſſion; that gave it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Apoſtles only.<note place="margin">Joh. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Sicut miſit me Pater, ſic, &amp;c.</hi> And all others that have it muſt receive it from them, or from ſuch as derive it from them by ſucceſſion. It is but reaſon that Chriſt ſhould have the choice of his own Miniſters. The Sheep that belong to thoſe other Shepherds, can plead nothing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32545:10"/>for their obedience to them. S. <hi>PAULS obedite praepoſitis,</hi> belongs not to them,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> they obey not thoſe that are ſet over them, but either thoſe that ſet themſelves over the flock, or the flock themſelves ſet them, and that not of neceſſity, which ſome vainly plead for them; but as neceſſary, profeſſing there is no lawful calling for a Miniſter, <hi>quem non miſit populus,</hi> where the Shepherd is not choſen by the Sheep. If theſe fall into an error by the miſguidance of their Shepherds, they are in a ſad and worſe condition, which admits no plea of excuſe or extenuation from the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. They muſt bear their own faults, and the miſguiding of the Shepherds, which they make their own by chooſing them. In a word, the favour that Chriſt doth is to his own, not the peoples Shepherds.</p>

And that is to ſubmit our ſelves to be led and guided by him. To turn to Chriſt is in effect to turn Chriſtian. We are no leſs concerned here. And that muſt be in two reſpects: in his <hi>office</hi> of Shepherd and Biſhop, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32545:11"/>in the <hi>execution</hi> of it by Shepherds and Biſhops.</p>

                  <p>And what will come of this at the laſt, our Saviour tells us in the Parable, where ſome had the boldneſs to plead for their entrance, that they had <hi>eat and drunk in his preſence,</hi>

And for the beſt of the flock, whom both Nature and Art hath fitted to maſter the greateſt difficulties of themſelves; if they ſhall ſeriouſly conſider how much and how oft Prejudice, Education, Cuſtom, Paſſion and Intereſt doth corrupt our Reaſon, we would in prudence ſometimes ſuſpect our own, and

I confeſs the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be a ſurer guide then Reaſon, for the <hi>Authors</hi> ſake; and yet, by what ye heard even now, it works little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, but yet ſurer for all that. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Scripture is a cauſe of erring. Ye <hi>erre,</hi> ſaith our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.29.</note> 
                     <hi>not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And to keep us right in our way Gods <hi>Word is a lantern to our feet, and a light unto our paths.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.105.</note> We cannot ſay too much of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and benefit of it. It is a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of all that concerns Heaven, or the way to it. It hath all the perfections that a <hi>law</hi> or rule can have to guide us; yet thoſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are confin'd within the limits and nature of a law, to do no more then is proper for a law to do, which is very little without a <hi>Judge</hi> to apply it. Though the rule be ſufficiently ſtraight &amp; perfect, yet it meaſures nothing out of the hand of him that hath skill to uſe it.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32545:14"/>Bring what controverſy you will to the laws, they pronounce nothing either for the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant.</hi> This is the true reaſon why, though all ſects pretend to Scripture, there is yet no end of controverſies, becauſe there is no common <hi>Judge</hi> to end them. And the reaſon why every ſect for all that ſeems to reſt ſatisfied, they are guided by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is becauſe they carry their Judge a-long with them, themſelves.</p>
                  <p>So as if together with the Scriptures there be not a Shepherd too, or ſome as little to be truſted, our ſelves I mean, it cannot lead at all.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> It is indeed a <hi>two-edged ſword,</hi> but cuts nothing, but in the hand of him that uſeth it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> A <hi>Third</hi> pretender to avoid the Shepherds is the SPIRIT. That without queſtion will lead us into all truth.<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note> But for the manner of the <hi>Spirits</hi> leading, the Scripture points out two wayes, The one <hi>Divines</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>i. e.</hi> as it led the Prophets of old, by revealing to them the truth and matter of the Propheſy, the object. And by this way it led all the Apoſtles, to whom the whole
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32545:14"/>doctrine of the Goſpel, and myſtery of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt was reveal'd.<note place="margin">2 P.t. 1.21.</note> And thus <hi>holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> To this way of leading none can pretend, that doth not prove his commiſſion from God by a <hi>miracle,</hi> who ſends none of ſuch an errand that cannot make it appear ſome way, that he came from him. If the <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> would have his dreams believed to be the dictates and revelations of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> let him ſhew his letters of Credence from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeal'd with a <hi>miracle,</hi> and I ſhall not doubt to ſet him above all the Doctors and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of the Church. Otherwiſe he may deceive himſelf by his ſpirit, he ſhall not deceive me.</p>
                  <p>The other way of the <hi>Spirits</hi> leading is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> not by <hi>revealing</hi> any thing to us, but by <hi>co-operating</hi> with us, by fortifying the ſoul and the faculties of it, to all ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural actions, by aſſiſtance of grace to inlighten the underſtanding to comprehend divine truth, to inflame the affections with the love of it, to ſupport our endeavours in all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and temptations. To this aſſiſtance of the Spirit all the faithful have a right. And though in this way the Spirit cannot deceive us, yet we may be deceived in it, becauſe it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32545:15"/>never works but with us; if we fail in what we are to do, then that fails us.</p>
                  <p>And by this way not only private perſons, but <hi>publick Councels</hi> are governed. To whom the Spirit doth not reveal the matter of their Decrees <gap reason="foreign">

For if any Councel might pretend to that other way of revelation, ſure that firſt famous <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Councel might, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.

                     <hi>v.</hi> 7. when there had been much debate and diſquiſition out of the Scriptures, were the decrees made and ſign'd accordingly. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 28.</note> The Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were in joynt commiſſion with the Spirit; the ſame Lord that ſent the Spirit, ſent the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles alſo, and therefore no contradiction to be led by the Spirit, and by the Shepherds too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> THE <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt leader which is brought in to avoid the Shepherds, is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32545:15"/>the CONSCIENCE. This is the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſtrongeſt fort againſt Obedience. If he can get his Conſcience about him, he thinks himſelf ſo ſafe that he may bid defiance to all Authority.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Commiſsion</hi> of leaders, I confeſs, as I ſaid, the Conſcience to be of the <hi>Quorum.</hi> We are to do nothing without it, and much leſs againſt it. But then we muſt be ſure we miſtake not ſomewhat elſe for the Conſcience. Every diſeaſe and diſtemper of the mind, cauſleſs ſcruple, ſlight perſwaſion, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fear is not the Conſcience, againſt which we are bound not to act.</p>
                  <p>The tender <hi>Conſcience,</hi> for which ſo much favour is pleaded, may prove in ſome no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a diſeaſe of the Soul, a ſpiritual <hi>Splene.</hi> For though it be good to be tender of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in any thing where it proceeds from the good temper and conſtitution of the ſoul, which is the ſame conſtantly in all caſes, and is not affected or taken up for a purpoſe, as the ſturdy begger carries his arm in a ſtring, that it may be a Patent to beg and be idle.</p>
                  <p>You may know it certainly to be a diſeaſe if it comes upon us by fits and ſtarts, as to be <hi>tender</hi> of offending God when we obey men,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32545:16"/>and <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>tender</hi> of offending God when we diſobey them. If they be not as tender of one ſide as of another, as I never find them to be, it is but a <hi>Paralitick</hi> Conſcience that is dead of one ſide. For tell him the Church commands it, he preſently ſhrinks and ſtartles at it; and well ſo, for poſſibly he may ſin againſt God. But tell him on the other ſide that God commands obedience to thoſe that rule over us, it moves him not at all, you may thruſt a needle into his ſide and he feels it not. It ſhews plainly the Conſcience hath a dead Palſy on that ſide.</p>
                  <p>But a right and ſound Conſcience againſt which certainly we ought not to act, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and well governed judgment; for not to amuſe you as the manner is with frivolous diſtinctions and <hi>definitions</hi> of Conſcience, in this caſe the Conſcience is nothing but every mans <hi>private</hi> judgment; for he ought not to attempt the doing of any thing, till he hath framed this judgment to himſelf, that it is lawful for him to do it. Now ſeeing our private judgment hath ſo great power and influence as to interrupt the courſe of publick, it had need be a true and regular judgment. As firſt,</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:32545:16"/>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> It muſt not be <hi>arbitrary,</hi> for that we think we have reaſon to decline in the publick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, to govern by Will and not by Law. Many a Conſcience if it were well examined, will prove to be nothing but will, not judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Every good judgment is upon a <hi>full</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cauſe of both ſides, all evidences duly weighed and examined, then reſolves; this is a Conſcience againſt which we ought not to act, though poſſibly it might prove to be erroneous; yet for all that we muſt know that it doth not ſet us free from the guilt of diſobeying our Governors. And then this is all the benefit our Conſcience will do us in caſe of error, that it caſts us into a <hi>neceſsity</hi> of ſinning, by obeying againſt our ſelves, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying againſt our Governors. We ſhall do well therefore to take care, that we make not every ſlight perſwaſion, doubt or ſcruple, a Conſcience, truſting to be diſcharged of our obedience by that, which indeed binds it faſter upon us, for that is the very end and benefit for which is inſtituted the Paſtoral charge, that when we are ſo weak we can not ſafely truſt our ſelves, we may rely upon that: unleſs we think it a good plea, I am
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32545:17"/>blind and therefore I will <hi>not</hi> be led. I am weak and ſickly, and therefore I will <hi>not</hi> be rul'd by the Phyſitian.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſum up all, if not <hi>Reaſon,</hi> nor <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor <hi>Conſcience</hi> will diſcharge us of the duty we owe to the Church, in the name of God, let us not raſhly fling away ſo great a bleſſing, that in all our doubts and fears, for our quiet and ſecurity, we may have recourſe to the Shepherds and Biſhops of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>THis is the <hi>laſt</hi> point, the Shepherds Flock or the Biſhops <hi>Dioceſs:</hi> the Souls of men. And here we meet with another quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel from the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> That they may be ſure to ſpoil the Biſhops of all authority, they take away their Dioceſs, the cure of Souls, that they may be Biſhops <hi>ſine titulo;</hi> for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops they are not either of our bodies or eſtates. And why not of our Souls? Chriſt indeed the great Shepherd that purchaſed them may rule them, but they are too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for any other Shepherds to Lord over: which they ſay is done by binding the Souls with <hi>Church-laws</hi> and cenſures, which Chriſt hath ſet at liberty. And thus they ſet up
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32545:17"/>Chriſt <hi>againſt</hi> himſelf, and Chriſtian liberty againſt Chriſtian duty.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul,</hi> I confeſs doth earneſtly preſs this point of liberty,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath made us free, and be not intangled again with the yoak of bondage.</hi> But what liberty? It is not ſimply from obedience either to men or Laws, for that were deſtructive to Humane Society as well as Religion. What then is it? It is no more then that Chriſtians have a liberty <hi>not</hi> to be Jews. I dare be bold to ſay, this is all that can be made of it. And the reaſon why S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo earneſtly preſs it is evident. The Jews that were willing enough to entertain the doctrine of Chriſt, yet were not ſo eaſily drawn to part with thoſe Rites and Ceremonies, to which they had been ſo long accuſtomed, and upon ſo good authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To humour theſe <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and his Diſciples ſet up a medly of both Religions, that they might be <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples and <hi>Moſes</hi> too. Againſt this doctrine S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, eſpecially in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians.</hi> If they have taken upon them to be Chriſtians let them ſtand to that, and not look back again to the fleſh <hi>having begun in the Spirit.</hi> For behold,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.3.</note> I <hi>Paul ſay unto you, if
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32545:18"/>ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> To claim from hence liberty from any other men or laws then the Jews,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note> they might as well ſay Chriſt hath here given them liberty not to be Chriſtians. For Chriſtians we cannot be, unleſs we obey the Laws and Government of thoſe that Chriſt hath ſet over us. To uſe our liberty in this caſe our Apoſtle in the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> hath adjudged it to be no better then a <hi>cloak of malitiouſneſs.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for thoſe Conſciences which are ſo tender that every Church-law pinches and galls them, they do without reluctance <hi>bind</hi> their own Souls. Every private man can do that which we will not indure the Church ſhould do. He that promiſeth any thing is bound in conſcience to perform it, though before he took that bond upon him, he had his Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty not to do it. Before <hi>Ananias</hi> promiſed to ſell his eſtate, and give it to the Church, he was free, S. <hi>Peter</hi> told him ſo; <hi>Was it not in thine own power?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 5.4.</note> Yet after that it was not in his power to make uſe of that liberty; for his conſcience was bound. And if a promiſe may do this, much more a vow or an oath. <hi>If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or ſwear an oath to bind his Soul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 30.2</note> Numb. 30.2. (the Soul
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32545:18"/>may be bound) <hi>he ſhall not break his word, he ſhall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a man ſhould be ſo unreaſonable as to ſay, his conſcience may be bound by himſelf, but not by any elſe. Do not they themſelves, as their manner is in their Sermons, <hi>bind</hi> over their hearers to anſwer for them at the day of judgment? and what a heap and load of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons muſt then ly upon their Conſciences? though the truth is, they bind none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that to repent for corrupting Gods Word, and miſleading the people into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sedition and Diſobedience, to ſay no worſe.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſeriouſly conſider and <hi>compare</hi> that which they would avoid, with that which they indeavour to ſet up in the room of it. They would avoid <hi>firſt</hi> the power of the Church in her Laws and Cenſures as a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering over mens conſciences, and a lording it over Gods inheritance. But if they look upon it with an impartial eye, they ſhall find all contrary, nothing but moderation; as firſt in the very ſtile of the Church, that there might be no <hi>harſh</hi> words. The laws by which they govern, are not call'd laws but <hi>canons,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:32545:19"/>that is, rules to guide, rather then ſorce.
<list>
                        <item>2. Church-puniſhments are not call'd <hi>poenae</hi> but <hi>cenſurae,</hi> not that they are ſweetned with good words only, but with real benefit; for they are not as temporal puniſhments <hi>ad vindictam</hi> but <hi>ad diſciplinam,</hi> for the amendment, not revenge of ſin.</item>
                        <item>3. The temporal judge, if not So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, <hi>cannot</hi> pardon the <hi>felony</hi> though he would.</item>
                     </list>
The Eccleſiaſtical judge cannot <hi>but pardon</hi> though he would not. <hi>Eccleſia non claudit gremium redeuntibus,</hi> is a rule in the Court Chriſtian. The Church refuſeth none that will return and repent. There is <hi>no</hi> ſuch rule in ſecular Courts, that the thief or murtherer upon repentance may be pardoned. And by <hi>Church-Canons</hi> in elder times it was deemed an irregularity to be preſent at a ſentence of blood. Not that it is a crime to be ſo, but as the Canon ſpeaks, <hi>propter defectum lenitatis,</hi> that nothing in them might ſeem to be of harſhneſs or cruelty. The higheſt and moſt terrible of all Church-cenſures, of which men ſeem to be moſt impatient, how harmleſs and gentle is it, <hi>Excommunication?</hi> If he be not guilty, <hi>clavibus errantibus,</hi> he is never the worſe for it; the bonds fall off themſelves; if he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32545:19"/>be guilty, he may be the better for it if he will. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> judged the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> to be delivered unto Satan,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.3.</note> and this was thought to be Excommunication and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more; yet this was for his benefit, for <hi>the deſtruction of the fleſh,</hi>

                     <hi>that the ſpirit might be ſaved in the day of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> verſe 5. What is there in all this that ſhould fright us from our obedience?</p>
                  <p>But now let us ſee what on the other ſide they would ſet up in the room of this. A <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> forſooth, from the fetters of laws, that they might not ſerve God in bonds like ſlaves, but freely. That they may preach what they will, and as long as they will. That they may pray how they will, and faſt when they will. That they may ſtand and kneel where and when they will. Indeed a true arbitrary <hi>Will-worſhip;</hi> inſtead of a lawful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſerving of God, a confuſion of all.</p>
                  <p>But they hold themſelves wrong'd to be charged with will-worſhip, for that they do all by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Yet for all that pretenſe they are ſtill under that charge; becauſe all theſe are at their own wills; what ſectary is there that with a wet finger cannot, nay doth not challenge Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32545:20"/>the Scripture, the Spirit and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be for him, when <hi>he will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And why do they allow theſe to guide them and not the Shepherds, but becauſe theſe are at their beck and <hi>will,</hi> but the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds are not? And therefore becauſe they cannot command them, they would be rid of them, that ſo they might without control, Lord it as they will.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall trouble you no longer with our <hi>Shepherds</hi> or their <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> but for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and caution reflect upon our ſelves: for though Chriſt hath committed the cure of our ſouls to others, he hath not taken it from our ſelves. The Shepherds were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a help to eaſe us in it, not to eaſe us of it. Every one may and muſt be by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current care a Shepherd and Biſhop to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and then here I ſhall take leave only to put you in mind of your Dioceſs, your <hi>Souls,</hi> that ye be not our Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The rich glutton in the Goſpel, when he ſaid to his Soul, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt much goods laid up for thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 12.19</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſure he miſtook his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32545:20"/>body for his Soul, for there was nothing in his barns that could feed that. This is no greater an error and miſtake then we dayly commit our ſelves; to go no farther then this preſent time. <hi>Lent,</hi> if there were any thing left of it among us but the name, charges the ſoul by prayer and faſting to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it ſelf to meet our Lord at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When we plead our conſtitution and health againſt it, it ſhews we are no ill <hi>Curates</hi> of our bodies, whatſoever we be of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Yea that which hath a better title to be our ſouls will not lie within this Cure; the <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi> and principal part of the ſoul, and the inriching it with the knowledge of Arts and Sciences, ſpeculative and practick, by which all our affairs and the greateſt of all the affairs of the world are governed, which employ the ſouls beſt vertues and indowments, and for which none but great and noble ſouls are fit. Yet this is not the ſoul for which Chriſt died, and is to be our Cure. For when we have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this and all the world beſides we may <hi>loſe our ſouls.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt takes no other notice of theſe then as if they were but bodies, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32545:21"/>indeed for their continuance they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they periſh with our bodies; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>wits</hi> and wiſeſt <hi>conduct</hi> lie buried in their duſt with them, nor will they appear again for us in that world where the ſoul is moſt concern'd. In a word, the Scripture owns no loſing or ſaving to the ſoul but in that condition which muſt live and continue for ever. Nothing is worthy that name that is not immortal. Yet I muſt recal my ſelf when I ſaid theſe mortal ſouls, that is, in their temporal condition, are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Cure; to get, it may be not, but to uſe they are. The meaneſt of them all our Saviour expreſly commits to our charge,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.9.</note>

And if you ſhall make you friends likewiſe of your <hi>honours, powers,</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> for the advantage of Gods honour and ſervice, certainly they will do as much for you as <hi>Mammon</hi> can.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have an <hi>Altar</hi> in the Tenth Verſe, and in this we have a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> But what Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and what Sacrifice? for they are ſcandalous words. For the Altar, let that fall, if the Sacrifice cannot ſupport it: But for the Sacrifice, whereof we are now to treat, it is, I confeſs, a word of offence, becauſe there goes under the name of a Chriſtian Sacrifice, that which our Church calls a <hi>blaſphemous fable,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Art. 31.</note> and <hi>dangerous deceit.</hi> Should I leave you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32545:24"/>any Caution upon that fear and danger in Sacrificing, it would be to little purpoſe to offer at the commending of any: For we are too often troubled more with words, than what they ſignifie. And therefore as the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> adviſeth, when ſuch a caſe ſhall happen <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigandas eſſe prius aures;</hi> ſomewhat muſt be ſaid beforehand to remove a prejudice that will fall upon all that ſhall be ſaid after. That which the <hi>Article</hi> ſpeaks of is the Sacrifice of the Maſs, wherein the Prieſts of that Sacrifice ſay, <hi>That Chriſt himſelf is really ſacrificed for the quick and dead:</hi> And for want of this, our Church is not by them allowed to have either Prieſt or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we pretend not to that Myſtical Art and Chymiſtry, to turn the Elements of Bread and Wine into the Natural Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which alone they make themſelves Prieſts, and <hi>Him</hi> the Sacrifice. I put in no <hi>claim</hi> therefore from this Text, either to that Prieſt, or this Sacrifice, but yet to a right in both, but both of another kinde: For the Sacrifice, the Text is clear, and the Prieſt follows of courſe; there can be no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice without him. And it is as clear too, That it is not the Sacrifice of the Maſs, though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32545:24"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> be in it; for 'tis <hi>he</hi> whom we firſt meet with in the Text, <hi>By him.</hi> Here indeed <hi>he</hi> is, but not in the quality of a Sacrifice to be offered, as in the Maſs, whereof <hi>he</hi> is the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but as a <hi>Mediator</hi> only. It is not <hi>Him,</hi> but <hi>By him</hi> we are to offer.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing we may be ſecure, it is not <hi>that</hi> we might poſſibly fear; let us ſee what it is we may ſafely, and muſt neceſſarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
                  <p>We are firſt to <hi>offer</hi> a Sacrifice <hi>to God.</hi>

                     <item>3. The <hi>Matter</hi> of it is to be, not the <hi>Fruit</hi> of our Fields, or of our Flocks, but of <hi>our Lips.</hi>

                     <item>6. It muſt be <hi>to Him,</hi> and not to any <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Saint,</hi> or <hi>Angel.</hi> Praiſe them we may, but offer a Sacrifice of praiſe, we muſt not.</item>
                     <item>7. It is not a Sacrifice to be done at ſtarts, and upon occaſions, but <hi>continually, a daily Sacrifice.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>Laſtly, You have the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why all this, <hi>Therefore;</hi> and that ſends us back to the Twelfth Verſe, <hi>Wherefore Jeſus, that he might ſanctifie the people by his Blood, ſuffered without the Gate.</hi> That he ſuffered for us, and that he ſuffered without the Gate, are the reaſons, why <hi>by him,</hi> and why <hi>of us. By him,</hi> becauſe by the ſacrificing of himſelf, he made our peace with God. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God for it.</hi> And why <hi>of us?</hi> Becauſe <hi>he ſuffered without the Gate;</hi> whither the <hi>Jews</hi> that were within the Gate muſt go out and follow him, in the next Verſe, leaving their <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> And we the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gate already, may find him in our own Territories, that ſo both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> joyntly together, as the word imports, <hi>May confeſs to the honour of his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Therefore</hi> carries in it the reaſon of our duty, ſo it doth in that ſame accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it hath to the time: For this is <hi>Paſsion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32545:25"/>Sunday;</hi> and why ſo called, we learn from <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus</hi> and others, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> on this day met together, to conſult of and contrive the death of <hi>our Lord;</hi> which, not many days after, they effected.</p>
                  <p>It will not be fit (I confeſs) for that reaſon, to anticipate the <hi>Meditations</hi> proper to that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. Yet as now the <hi>Paſsion</hi> was in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and conception by them, it will be ſo far a keeping of time with it, if we alſo now ſhall prepare a Sacrifice of praiſe for it, that we may be fit then to honor God by confeſſing to his Name, the wonderful mercies and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable benefits we receive by the <hi>Paſsion</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection of our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By him therefore let us offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe to God continually, that is, the Fruit of our lips, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing to his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that we may the better perform our <hi>Sacrifice of Praiſe, Let us by him alſo offer a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Prayer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>THat we are to <hi>offer</hi> a SACRIFICE <hi>to God,</hi> is here ſo plainly enjoyned, and ſo punctually deſcribed, both for <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> in every <hi>circumſtance,</hi> that one would think it ſtrange it ſhould be neglected, and more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32545:26"/>ſtrange it ſhould be contemned by any. But for our ſelves, if we would be clear in this <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (as every good man ſhould deſire to be) it is fit we call our ſelves to account when, and how we perform it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Primitive Church</hi> (of whom this may beſt be learned) did, in conſcience of their duty herein, compoſe ſeveral <hi>Liturgies,</hi> that by them they might have a <hi>Publick daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> for the honor and worſhip of <hi>God;</hi> as that of St. <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> St. <hi>Marks</hi> at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi> after that, St. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> St. <hi>Baſils</hi> at <hi>Caeſaria,</hi> St. <hi>Gregories</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there was no Church without one. They that wrote <hi>Apologies</hi> for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> being of the <hi>Heathen</hi> accuſed of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> becauſe they were never ſeen to offer ſacrifice to the Gods for anſwer to <hi>that,</hi> had recourſe to this <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Praiſe</hi> in the Text.</p>
                  <p>The Copies of thoſe <hi>Ancient Liturgies,</hi> as they come now to our hands, have no doubt ſuffered the fate of time, that is, ſome changes, by which the prepoſterous zeal of ſome hath overcharged them with numerous, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuperſtitious <hi>Additions;</hi> yet the ſubſtance and intendment of them was to perform this duty. And therefore <hi>our Church,</hi> that never
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32545:26"/>was of the mind to fling away Chaff and Corn, both at once, That they might not want what all Churches ever had; ſo ordered our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> that by it we might with ſafety and true devotion, daily <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the praiſe and honor of God. Wherein they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, not only the <hi>Precept,</hi> but <hi>Patern</hi> alſo from this Text, as by a ſhort parallel between them, may viſibly appear; as firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The Text calls us to a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> is that <hi>Sacrifice. Antioch</hi> was the place where <hi>Chriſts Diſciples</hi> were firſt called <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> is the place where the <hi>Chriſtian Service</hi> is firſt called a <hi>Liturgie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> We find the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> met together at their <hi>Liturgie.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Verſe 2.</note> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, <hi>Faſting and Miniſtring to the Lord;</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> properly ſignifies a <hi>Publick Miniſtration;</hi> to which, the word uſed by the <hi>Church,</hi> fits well, calling it <hi>Common Prayer;</hi> and is ſo expounded by St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf in the next Verſe, <hi>VVhen they had Faſted and Prayed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> This <hi>Liturgie</hi> or <hi>Miniſtring to God,</hi> muſt needs be in ſomething for <hi>His honor and ſervice,</hi> which is properly a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, As it is a Sacrifice to <hi>God,</hi> ſo to none but <hi>God:</hi> We call it <hi>Divine Service,</hi> and ſo we uſe it. No <hi>Creature, Saint,</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32545:27"/>any part in it, as in ſome they have. <hi>Praiſe</hi> them we may for the good ſervice they have done the <hi>Church;</hi> but offer a <hi>Sacrifice of Praiſe</hi> we may not. It was never heard, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine, Offero tibi Sacrificium, Petre,</hi> or <hi>Paule,</hi> or <hi>Cypriane.</hi> And though the invocation of them ſimply be not a Sacrifice, yet it is ſuch, when uſed in <hi>Divine Service</hi> in the place of one. And that it is not heard in our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> it is no doubt, with their good leave and liking too. The <hi>Angel, Rev.</hi> 19. will anſwer for <hi>that</hi> Order: When St. <hi>John</hi> would have worſhipp'd him, <hi>Do it not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I am your fellow ſervant.</hi> And the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for <hi>their</hi> Order, when the men of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> would have ſacrificed to them, they cried out, <hi>Sirs, why do you theſe things?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 14.15.</note> 
                     <hi>we alſo are men of the like Paſsions with you.</hi> That they are <hi>Gods</hi> friends, intitles them to no more than a place in his Court to <hi>do him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> not in his Throne to <hi>receive</hi> any. And therefore that honor which <hi>God</hi> hath not given to another, we have not given to them in our <hi>Liturgie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, The Sacrifice of the Text is <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical,</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice of Praiſe,</hi> and ſo is our <hi>Liturgie.</hi> We pretend to no expiation or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſins, either of quick or dead:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32545:27"/>We owe <hi>that</hi> to a better Sacrifice. The price of <hi>Redemption</hi> is greater than any ſervice we can do: It coſt more to redeem our ſouls, we muſt let that alone for ever; and therefore in the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> our Sacrifice is ſet to no higher key, than, <hi>VVe praiſe thee, O God,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, In every Sacrifice there muſt be ſomething offered, and that in the Text is <hi>the fruit of our Lips:</hi> For though the Root of this and every good ſervice, muſt be in the <hi>heart,</hi> yet the fruit muſt ſprout outwardly in the <hi>lips.</hi> For though a <hi>vertue</hi> may ſometimes be accompliſhed in the heart only, yet neither this nor <hi>Prayer</hi> it ſelf, if private or mental on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (though otherwiſe of excellent uſe) will amount to a Sacrifice, till it come into the lips; for no proper Sacrifice is inviſible: And therefore in our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> as we pray, that <hi>God</hi> would <hi>open our lips;</hi> ſo we practiſe when we joyn with the Prieſt in the <hi>Confeſsions</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in ſuch things where he alone is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, It is not every fruit that grows upon the lips, is fit to make a Sacrifice, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>lips that confeſs to his Name.</hi> But how comes confeſſing more than anything elſe, to relate to a Sacrifice? It is thus. The end
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32545:28"/>and import of every thing offered to <hi>God</hi> in Sacrifice <hi>Euchariſtical,</hi> is a Profeſſion and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of <hi>ſome bleſsing</hi> beſtowed upon the Sacrificer; and ſo either expreſly or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely is joyned with it. As for inſtance; At the offering of the <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make a <hi>Confeſsion</hi> in this form. <hi>Thou ſhalt go unto the Prieſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 26.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſay thus unto him, I confeſs this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come into the Country which the Lord ſware unto our Fathers to give us;</hi> That is, in the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> they confeſs the Land that bore them to be of <hi>Gods</hi> gift. Now of ſuch confeſſions as theſe, the whole body and matter of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> is framed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Our firſt addreſs and approach into <hi>Gods</hi> preſence is, by a <hi>Confeſsion of our ſins,</hi> which is a putting off our ſhooes with the defilements we have contracted in our ways; for the place and preſence is holy. And by this we make Profeſſion and Acknowledgment of <hi>Gods</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purity and holineſs, in that we preſume not to come into his preſence, till we firſt put off our uncleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Then follows the <hi>Abſolution;</hi> and this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Confeſſion of his infinite mercy, that he is willing to forgive our ſins, and to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32545:28"/>uſe the miniſtry of ſinful man, to confer it upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Then we have the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which is a third Confeſſion to his Name, whereby we do with chearful and thankful hearts, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be the <hi>Author</hi> of all the good we enjoy, or hope for.</p>

                  <p>And to this I ſhall not <hi>beg</hi> the aſſent of thoſe that like it not, but <hi>require it;</hi> and by the authority of the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in another place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. where we read, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion for the truth of God, to confirm the promiſe made unto the Fathers.</hi> Now what that promiſe was, he tells us in the next verſe. <hi>That the Gentiles might glorifie God for his mercy, as it is written, For this cauſe I will confeſs to thee among the Gentiles, and ſing praiſes unto thy Name.</hi> Here are Confeſſions,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32545:30"/>and praiſes, and Singing, by which <hi>God</hi> is to be glorified among the Gentiles: They that will be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> upon other terms, do in effect make <hi>God</hi> a lier, who promiſed it ſhould be ſo.</p>
                  <p>And yet they that would not have it ſo, are very many, and of many ſorts; and though I cannot think the worſe of it, that it lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a popular diſlike; yet becauſe it is no ill way of learning our duties by the folly of thoſe that oppoſe it, I ſhall give you a ſhort account of them.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, They ſay it is a <hi>polluted unclean thing,</hi> taken out of the <hi>Popiſh Miſſal</hi> and <hi>Breviary:</hi> But if it be truly according to the patern in the Text, as ye have heard, a <hi>Sacrifice of praiſe to God,</hi> we need not be troubled through what hands it paſſed before it came to us: For as we are not aſhamed to confeſs that our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is not a <hi>new,</hi> but <hi>Reform'd Religion;</hi> ſo, nor need we be aſhamed to ſay, We worſhip <hi>God,</hi> not by a <hi>new,</hi> but <hi>Reform'd Liturgie:</hi> And ſo our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> are both of a piece, and both as old as the Text.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, They ſay it is <hi>a dead Sacrifice,</hi> made up of empty <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> void of that life and affection which is neceſſary in <hi>Gods ſervice.</hi> If there be that want of affection in our Prayers, it is a fault, lie where it may: But certainly the <hi>Forms</hi> are not guilty of it. It is injuſtice to require that in a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which belongs only to him that <hi>offers</hi> it. The <hi>Church</hi> that compoſed the <hi>Forms</hi> cannot create <hi>affection.</hi> If we come to this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and leave our hearts behind us, I know where the blame muſt lie.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, you do not accuſe <hi>Set Forms,</hi> for want of life in themſelves, but that by the continual repetition of the ſame things, they be-dead <hi>affection</hi> in thoſe that ſhould have it. And how, I pray, ſhould that be? If the ſenſe of <hi>real wants</hi> and <hi>bleſsings,</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, cannot keep up our <hi>affections,</hi> how ſhould a new ſet of words do it? Can we imagine that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be taken with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and ſhift of phraſes, or that the <hi>affection</hi> that takes heat from them, will render the <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> more acceptable to <hi>God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, when they complain that their devotion is tired with nothing but <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and moſt merciful Father,</hi> in the <hi>Morning;</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:32545:32"/>and <hi>Almighty and moſt merciful Father,</hi> in the <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and the ſame over and over again every day: That complaint did never lie againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> daily Sacrifice, which was a type of ours; that there was a <hi>Lamb</hi> in the <hi>morning,</hi> and a <hi>Lamb</hi> again at <hi>evening;</hi> and the ſame over again every day in the year. When our <hi>Savour</hi> at his laſt agony in the <hi>Garden,</hi> three times retired himſelf from his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to pray, he uſed ſtill the ſame form of words without any change, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.44. And who dares ſay he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ability</hi> to vary <hi>his prayer,</hi> or can ſay, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>affection,</hi> though he did not? For as St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates it, <hi>He prayed ſo earneſlly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>St.</hi> Luke 22.24.</note> 
                     <hi>that his ſwet was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground;</hi> and then ſure there was no want of <hi>affection;</hi> for when our zeal is at the hotteſt, we do not uſe to ſwet at our prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> I go on to a third charge; That Set forms, inſtead of helping us, <hi>hinder the Spirit</hi> by which we ſhould pray. The truth is, Such as the Spirit may be, and too often uſeth to be, it ought rather to be bound with chains, than left at liberty; under a Form of Praying, to <hi>Libel</hi> their Governors, or whom, or what they pleaſe to bring into hatred with the people: But for the true Spirit of Prayer, that cannot
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32545:33"/>be tyed with words: For they are utterly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken that think the Spirit of Prayer, ſupplies any defect of words or phraſes; for that very Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whereon they ground it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</hi> But in what? not in words; for what the Spirit ſupplies are there ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>not ſpoken at all;</hi> or, as we tranſlate it, <hi>which cannot be uttered.</hi> What then doth it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? <hi>It maketh interceſsion for us with groans, which cannot be uttered.</hi> The true Spirit of Prayer conſiſts in groans, in zeal, and fervency; and that, where it is, will animate and put life into any Form of Prayer. They who call Forms of their own making, or borrowing, con'd without Book, Praying by the Spirit, do both cheat the people, and blaſpheme the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> A Fourth Objection is, That it is but a Book-Sacrifice, a <hi>Reading-Service,</hi> which <hi>any child</hi> may do. They complain it ſeems of caſe: If <hi>God</hi> ſhould require a harder thing of us, as no doubt there are many harder things to be done, do them we muſt.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32545:33"/>kill and dreſs a <hi>Lamb,</hi> as well as a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> This is a falſe, deceitful weight. <hi>Gods ſervice</hi> is not to be weighed by <hi>the labor</hi> of doing, but by <hi>the relation</hi> to him, for whom it is done: And therefore King <hi>Solomon,</hi> when, by the advice of his Father upon his death-bed, he call'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the chief Leaders in the rebellion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniah,</hi> as <hi>Joab</hi> that commanded in chief, and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> made no queſtion of putting <hi>Adoniah</hi> and <hi>Joab</hi> to death; but for <hi>Abiathar,</hi> though he deprived him of his office, yet he ſpared his life. And why? he gives no other reaſon but this, <hi>Becauſe he bore the Ark before his Father David.</hi> But was that a work of ſuch merit and difficulty? Could not any Porter do as much? it was but carrying of a Cheſt. <hi>Solomon</hi> did not take his meaſure by that. That <hi>Sacred Cheſt,</hi> the <hi>Ark,</hi> was a <hi>Symbol</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> preſence; it had relation to his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and that he preferred before his own; for <hi>Adoniah</hi> was his Brother of the half-blood, and <hi>Joab</hi> his coſin-german.</p>
                  <p>You that are the <hi>Kings ſervants</hi> here in Court, do not weigh the merit and honor of your places, which you juſtly have, by the pains and difficulty of your ſervice, which we know in many is little enough, but by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

The tediouſneſs which is cauſed by the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>Service,</hi> is cured by the <hi>end.</hi> It muſt needs be a leſs trouble to us, if we conſider it to be <hi>an honor for God.</hi> To ſay no more, How can we think thoſe <hi>Prayers</hi> too long, in which we our ſelves ſue for <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, if the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> ſhould, as they ſay, prove a hinderance to <hi>Preaching,</hi> I had ſo much the leſs to ſay for it: But how that ſhould be, I underſtand not. The <hi>Wiſe man</hi> aſſures us, <hi>there is a time for all things,</hi> and ſure then there is a time for <hi>two</hi> things, <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> both. But poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly we may be ſo ſurpriſed, that there is not time for both; The <hi>Caſe</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> here will be, which of them may beſt be ſpared. The <hi>Prayers</hi> are to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Sermons</hi> to us; the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> for <hi>Gods honor,</hi> the <hi>Sermons</hi> for our profit. In this caſe, I think I may ſafely leave every man to be his own Caſuiſt, and go on to the next.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> It is <hi>defective,</hi> and ſo a lame Sacrifice. How inconſiſtent are their complaints, and how hard are they to be pleaſed? It is both too long and too ſhort. They mean it is too long in the whole, and too ſhort in the parts. In the

                     <hi>Confeſsion of ſins,</hi> in the <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> in the <hi>Collects,</hi> many material things omitted. The Scriptures read in broken pieces, and not in order.</p>
                  <p>Theſe would not be counted <hi>defects,</hi> if we conſider their <hi>end</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> in the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which is to be a <hi>Sacrifice of praiſe to God,</hi> for that is ſufficiently attained by them as they are there uſed.</p>
                  <p>It is true, if we reſpect theſe <hi>duties</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their immediate <hi>proper effects,</hi> the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Forms</hi> are <hi>inſufficient;</hi> for no man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of <hi>Remiſsion of ſins,</hi> unleſs he confeſs to <hi>God</hi> the particulars wherein he hath offended.

                  <p>But they are utterly miſtaken in the uſe of a <hi>Liturgie,</hi> that would have it to be a <hi>commonſtore</hi> to furniſh out every <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to ſerve for the publick honoring, and praiſing of <hi>God:</hi> For if particulars ſhould be named, wherein all are not concerned, how can they truly and heartily ſay <hi>Amen?</hi> And likewiſe, when ſome <hi>portions</hi> only of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32545:36"/>Scripture are read, it is to ſuit the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and ſolemnity.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> I will add but one exception more. They ſay it is a blind Sacrifice, and <hi>edifies not.</hi> To edifie is to contribute to the building of us up in <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>godlineſs;</hi> and then <hi>not edifying,</hi> the meaning muſt be, that it is good for nothing. And truly, if it be ſo, it is but reaſon we ſhould part with it.</p>
                  <p>But poſſibly when they ſay, <hi>It doth not edifie,</hi> it may have ſome other meaning in it. They may ſay <hi>it edifies not,</hi> becauſe they like it not, or are not pleaſed and ſatisfied with the <hi>uſe</hi> of it; or, which is nearer the true meaning of the word, there is nothing of <hi>inſtruction</hi> in it, which they have not heard a thouſand times before.</p>
                  <p>They who come to <hi>Prayers</hi> for theſe <hi>ends,</hi> may indeed be diſappointed, becauſe they come without their errant. This is a <hi>Sacrifice
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32545:36"/>for the praiſe and honor of God;</hi> if it edifies <hi>that,</hi> we have no cauſe to complain. A <hi>Sermon,</hi> I confeſs, may fit our turns better in both theſe reſpects, if it be as it ſhould be: It is no doubt a more pleaſing entertainment of the time, if it be to edifie our liking; and fitter for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, if it be to edifie <hi>our learning.</hi> But then to ſay, <hi>Divine Service</hi> doth not thus edifie, is to blame the <hi>Prayers,</hi> becauſe they are not a <hi>Sermon.</hi> You would take it ill, as well you might, if I ſhould except againſt <hi>Sermons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not <hi>Prayers, i. e.</hi> a Sacrifice of praiſe for the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> as certainly they are not. But let both have their <hi>dues,</hi> and they are both good <hi>edifiers;</hi> The <hi>Sermon</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> the other of the <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Worſhip of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, that part, which, of all the reſt, ſeems leaſt to edifie, The <hi>Hymns,</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Anthems</hi> with Muſick, edifie the praiſe of <hi>God. I will praiſe the name of God with a ſung, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it with thankſgiving, Pſal.</hi> 69.30. Yea, the very <hi>inſtruments</hi> themſelves have their part in praiſing <hi>God. Therefore will I praiſe thee, and thy faithfulneſs, O God, playing upon an Inſtrument of Muſick. Unto Thee will I ſing upon the Harp, O thou holy One of Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 71.20. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32545:37"/>may be allowed to <hi>David,</hi> to uſe the Art wherein he excelled, and may agree with the <hi>Jewiſh ſervice,</hi> but not with the <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Nay St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.8.</note> in the place I named before, aſſures us, That it was a promiſe made to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould ſo glorifie <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing to Him,</hi> and <hi>Singing to His Name,</hi> the very <hi>Singing</hi> is not omitted; and that not <hi>of Him</hi> only, but <hi>to Him;</hi> which ſeems ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to ſome, to ſing <hi>our Prayers,</hi> or any thing that is offered to <hi>God:</hi> But it did not ſo to him that knew it better, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.33. <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, as long as I live; I will ſing praiſes unto my God, while I have my being.</hi> What ever others think, he was reſolved to live and die in it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall trouble you with no more of their <hi>Objections:</hi> Theſe only I have taken out of a greater heap, becauſe they are ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the <hi>Plain Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> and are the moſt <hi>popular inſinuations</hi> wherewith unwary people have been deluded.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, though we ſee no reaſon to <hi>approve</hi> of theſe men, yet have we not reaſon to <hi>pity</hi> them? For they are content to loſe their <hi>Livings</hi> for their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> What they loſe, I cannot ſay; but for <hi>pitying</hi> them, I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32545:37"/>ſhould be apt enough, if I did not ſee ſome Gallants venture more for a young wanton Miſtreſs, than others for a chaſt and ſober wife. If they be ſo fond of their <hi>new Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> as young lovers are in the firſt heat of their <hi>affection,</hi> who ſay, That they had rather beg together, than part; who can help it? Yet I will hope that a little more time, and a little leſs Indulgence, which uſes to make the one, will make the other wiſer too.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I leave them, and come to <hi>Our ſelves,</hi> whoſe Judgments have not been ſo far corrupted as to be enemies to the <hi>Liturgie;</hi> yet, I know not how, ſomething hath ſo poiſoned our Affections, that we are not ſo good friends to it as might be wiſhed. We care but little to come to it, and have as little reſpect when we are at it; we fit it out, or talk it out, ſo as nothing ſeems to be more impertinent, and wherein we are leſs concerned, than in this Service. Why will you go to Church? ſay they; there's nothing but Prayers. That is in words at length, There's nothing but praiſing and honouring God.</p>
                  <p>It is not poſſible, that any could be thus bold with their Creator, if they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32545:38"/>themſelves with a perſwaſion that a full amends may be made him another way. That obedience to Gods Commands, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and godly life is the beſt Sacrifice. <hi>He that keepeth the Law,</hi>

The Sacrifice of obedience is <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, i. e. God</hi> accepts it as well as if it had been a Sacrifice, that is, ſomething given to himſelf. But the Sacrifice of praiſe is <hi>proper</hi> without a <hi>Metaphor.</hi> The original word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> I confeſs, imports ſomething to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but that is meer accidental to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacrifice. It doth diſtinguiſh the <hi>kind,</hi> but not conſtitute the <hi>nature</hi> of it, which is accompliſhed by offering ſomething to God in acknowledgment of him. And for this uſe, <hi>the fruit of our lips</hi> is as proper, as the fruit of our flocks, or of our fields, ever were.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:32545:38"/>
                  <p>So likewiſe the honor which God receives from our <hi>obedience,</hi> differs from that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> is only of <hi>conſequence,</hi> and by argumentation, <hi>i. e.</hi> It ſuits with the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God; as we ſay, Good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are an <hi>honor</hi> to their Maſters, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection: But the honor by Sacrifice is of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> and ſpecial <hi>intendment,</hi> it hath no other uſe, and is a diſtinct vertue from all other acts of <hi>obedience,</hi> and of a different obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not trouble you with theſe nice diſtinctions, if they did not carry with them matter of important conſequence; leaſt a <hi>neceſſary ſervice</hi> ſhould be ſhuffled up, and quite loſt in the croud of other duties. For, though God hath the <hi>honor of obedience</hi> and a <hi>vertuous life,</hi> if we deny him the honor of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> beſides, we rob him of his due; and a greater Sacriledge we cannot commit: For that which goes upon the <hi>common account</hi> of Sacriledge, robs God only of things dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for <hi>his ſervice;</hi> (and yet that crime hath fired the neſts of thoſe, that took <hi>Coals from the Altar,</hi> to warm their own <hi>harths</hi>) but this is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32545:39"/>the robbing God of the <hi>Service</hi> it ſelf, to which the other is but an <hi>acceſſory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a fallacy, and piece of practick ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry that cozens the world, for men to think themſelves diſcharged of one duty by the zeal they bear to another; as if God were not rob'd ſo long as we leave him any thing.</p>
                  <p>Now, as it is well worth our care, that <hi>this</hi> Service be not loſt in the crowd of other <hi>duties,</hi> ſo will it be much more, that it be not loſt in worſe company, in a throng of <hi>Vices.</hi> And loſt it will be, when the vertue of it is gone.<note place="margin">Pſal. 107.34.</note> 
                     <hi>Afruitful land is made barren by the ſins of them that dwell therein.</hi> The ſame cauſe will make our Prayers as fruitleſs as our fields. To honour God with our <hi>lips,</hi> and diſhonour him with our <hi>lives;</hi> to be ſtrict at Prayers, and looſe to all diſorders; The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> pretenſions cannot make our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable as our ſins can: They make God complain of that which he himſelf command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Iſai. 1.11. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord; I am full with the burnt offerings of Rams, and the fat of fed Beaſts.</hi> And again, <hi>Bring no more vain Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32545:39"/>Incenſe is an abomination unto me:</hi> So it was with the Jews Sacrifice; and the Chriſtians will fare no better, ver. 15. <hi>When ye ſpread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, and when ye make many Prayers I will not hear:</hi> Whence grows the diſpleaſure that God takes againſt his own Service, but from this? <hi>Your hands are full of blood.</hi> He will accept no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> from polluted hands. And therefore to reconcile him to his own Service, he puts us into this courſe, verſe 16. <hi>VVaſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek Judgement, relieve the oppreſſed, plead for the widow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we come thus minded and prepared to Gods Altar, and offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe to the honour of his Name, we may with confidence expect, what God in the ſame caſe promiſed, 1 Sam. 2.30. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude. All that I have ſaid hitherto is only to vindicate <hi>Gods Service</hi> from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and to reſtore it to ſome of the reſpect due to it. And this, though the <hi>froward times</hi> did not need, cannot I hope be thought an ill office
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32545:40"/>for a <hi>Sermon,</hi> once to be an Advocate for <hi>Prayer,</hi> ſeeing Prayers will always do as much for the Sermon, be an Advocate to God to bring down a bleſſing upon it.

                  <p>COncerning our care about hearing, it will not be amiſs to beſtow the firſt part of it about the meaning of the Words. St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates the ſame paſſage with ſome difference.</p>

                     <hi>Tade heed</hi> how <hi>your hear.</hi> That which is <hi>quid</hi> here, is <hi>quomodo</hi> there. The difficulty will be, Whether St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſhould expound St. <hi>Luke,</hi> or St. <hi>Luke</hi> St. <hi>Mark?</hi> for in relating matter of fact, the truth muſt be one, though the words differ: And yet the words do not ſo differ, but that in Scripture the one is ſometimes taken for the other, <hi>quid</hi> for <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo,</hi> and <hi>quomodo</hi> for <hi>quid:</hi> Gen. 2.19. <hi>God brought all the beaſts of the field and fouls of the air to</hi> Adam, <hi>to ſee what he would call them.

It will be to no purpoſe how we hear, unleſs we hear what we ſhould: and it will be to as little to hear what we ſhould, if we care not how we hear it. If we take them both in, they will compleat our care in the two parts of it, and alſo make two Points of the Sermon, <hi>VVhat</hi> we hear, and <hi>How</hi> we hear.</p>

                  <p>But how can that be given in caution to the Hearer which is not in his power? for it is wholly at the choice of the Speaker what we hear: When the Ear is open it muſt hear what is ſpoken, whether it be good or bad. True, if the Precept had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Ear, ſo it muſt be; but it is given to the Hearer, to him that hath an <hi>Imperium</hi> and ruling of that and all the other ſenſes. If the reaſon or will ſhall command, the Ear will open or ſhut, like or diſlike. It is not ſimple hearing, the Senſe it ſelf is not capable of advice, but mix'd.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the reaſon why the Goſpel being preach'd to the

And ſo to take heed what you hear, is in effect to take heed what Faith and Credit you give to that you hear; for ſo it follows in the Verſe, <hi>VVith what meaſure you mete it ſhall be meaſur'd to you,</hi> the benefit will anſwer to the care, meaſure for meaſure.

So as now we need not aſcend to Heaven to fetch Chriſt down, nor the Holy Ghoſt, as ſome pretend to do to know Gods will, but to receive it only from that Scripture. Thus far we have the Word of God in <hi>Proper, (i. e.)</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately out of the mouth of God, and our hearing muſt be abſolute for the matter, we muſt ſay with <hi>Samuel, Speak Lord, for thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant heareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when it pleaſed God to commit the diſpenſing of that word to the Paſtors of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32545:44"/>Church, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. Now the word of God was come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the hands of men ſubject to infirmities and error, who may both deceive themſelves and others. And here our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours advice comes in ſeaſon, <hi>Take heed what you hear.</hi> Before, Gods word was in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but here only in the Tranſcript, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and ſome Copyings are more happy than others, and come nearer the Original, and therefore not all of the ſame value and eſteem. All Preachers are not to be heard alike, nor all Sermons. The word of God in them is ſo the water of Life, that it often taſtes of the <hi>mineral,</hi> through which it runs, and hath a tincture from the earthen Veſſel that brings it, and therefore not to be receiv'd with that meaſure of truſt which belongs to the pure and proper word of God. For, take a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at the beſt, the moſt you can make of it is, that it is Gods word only in a qualified ſenſe, becauſe the Church intends it ſhould be ſo; and it is the Preachers judgment and opinion that it is ſo; and poſſibly it may be ſo indeed. But then becauſe poſſibly it may not be ſo, we had need <hi>take heed what we hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:32545:44"/>
                  <p>We learn from St. <hi>Paul</hi> that it was more than poſſible, it was truly ſo then; for he warns <hi>Timothy</hi> of Preachers <hi>that will ſtrive about words to no purpoſe, but to the ſubverſion of the hearers,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. And verſe 16. <hi>By pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and vain bablings do increaſe to more ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And verſe 17. <hi>Their word will eat as doth a Canker, or a Gangrain;</hi> for ſo the Greek word is; and that's a dangerous Diſeaſe, and by all means poſſible to be avoided, and eſpecially to be taken heed of. Thus it was in the early times of the Church, we have reaſon then to look for worſe after, and ſo we of late times found it by ſad experience: Not only profane and vain bablings, but Sedition, Treaſon, Rebellion were dreſt up and appear'd in the likeneſs of Sermons. It is too plain, we have but too much need of caution to take heed.</p>
                  <p>But alas! what ſhould <hi>private men</hi> do? muſt they, or can they call all Preachers and Doctrines to account? The Scriptures indeed which are the undoubted Word of God would do it if well manag'd, but how can that be hoped from every hand? wherein wiſe, that is, learned men, are miſtaken, and from whence every Sect ſeeks Patronage, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32545:45"/>perſwades it ſelf to have it. What means is there then left by the help whereof we may take heed what we hear. Truly none that I know, but this ſtill, the Scriptures are the only infallible rule.</p>
                  <p>But how! Not left looſe to the prejudices and fancies of every man; for then it will fall out, as with thoſe that look in a <hi>Glaſs,</hi> in which every one ſees his own face, though not anothers; the reaſon is becauſe he brings his face to the Glaſs, not becauſe it was there before. So every <hi>Sect</hi> ſees the face of his own Religion in the Scripture, not becauſe it was there before, but becauſe his ſtrong fancy and prejudice brought it thither; he thinks he ſees that in the Scripture, which in truth is only in his own imagination.</p>
                  <p>But how then can we have any help from the Scriptures to take heed what we hear? Not as Gods word lies diffus'd through the whole body of them; but as prepar'd and fitted up in a ſummary and ſhort <hi>form of wholſom words</hi> by ſuch to whom the care of the Church is committed.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall think this a humane invention derogatory to the ſufficiency of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let him implead St. <hi>Paul</hi> firſt, who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32545:45"/>made the ſame uſe of it, finding what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief falſe Teachers had done, charges <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> with the care of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame courſe was taken by the whole Church after conſidering how hard, or rather impoſſible it was for every one out of the Scriptures to work out to himſelf an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the knowledge of as much as was neceſſary to ſalvation, and with that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the reſt of the faithful, who are commanded to ſpeak and think the ſame things, which cannot be done but in a certain form of words. Such a form,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.10.</note> if not the ſame with S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, was the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> the uſe whereof hath ever ſince continued in the Church to be a help to take heed what we believe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame courſe was of later times held by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32545:46"/>divers particular National Churches, who weary with the inſolence and domineering of their Siſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> did <hi>ſuo jure uti,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves, which ſell out in a time when the world was filled with Controverſies and Diſputes of Religion. That the people might not <hi>be carried about with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> that blew from all corners, it was their care, and wiſdom to compoſe a form of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words in their ſeveral <hi>Confeſsions,</hi> to be a rule what to hear.</p>
                  <p>Now following our Saviours advice, you have reaſon to ask, With what meaſure of Faith are theſe confeſſions to be received; for, <hi>Quis cuſtodiet ipſum cuſtodem?</hi> What cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit muſt be given to that which muſt be a rule how far we credit others? That we miſtake not, They are not to be received with that faith which is due to Gods word, or any thing out of it as neceſſary to ſalvation; but with ſuch as wiſe men would give to the means of ſetling unity and conſent in matters contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as the title of <hi>our</hi> Confeſſion imports; that is, That they are Articles of <hi>Peace</hi> not Articles of Faith. They make no new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or new Faith.</p>
                  <p>This, by the way, gives an eaſie Anſwer
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32545:46"/>to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hard Queſtion, as they think; <hi>Where was your Religion before</hi> Luther? <hi>Where was your Church before the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles?</hi> We do not date our Religion from thoſe Articles. The Church of <hi>England</hi> (I grant) is call'd ſo from their Confeſſion, but by an <hi>accidental</hi> denomination; <hi>i.e.</hi> It is that Church which for preſervation of unity and peace in it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns nothing to be taught or heard for God's Word which is repugnant to them in the particulars there mentioned. But for the <hi>eſſential</hi> denomination of our Faith, whereon Salvation depends, it is the Faith of God's Word, ſumm'd up in the ancient Catholick and Apoſtolick Forms; as is evident from our <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> and Practice. For when any is received as a Member into the Church by <hi>Baptiſin,</hi> the Laver of Regeneration, no other Faith is required but that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the Apoſtles Creed. And when by a confeſſion of our Faith and Sins, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to receive the <hi>other</hi> Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord, our Faith is that according to the ancient <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. And in the Office of <hi>Viſiting</hi> the Sick, the Abſolution (a comfort at all times, and moſt of all when we give up our Souls into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32545:47"/>Hands of God) is not to be adminiſtred but to thoſe that make confeſſion as well of their Faith as of their Sins; and that Faith is only according to the <hi>Apoſtles Creed.</hi> Thus are we born, nouriſh'd, and diſſolv'd by the ſame Faith, according to the ancient Catholick and Apoſtolick Forms. A Faith of this age nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought they to reproach, nor we to be aſham'd of.</p>
                  <p>To return to <hi>our</hi> particular Church <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion;</hi> it hath another end and uſe; they are <hi>Articles</hi> of peace and conſent in certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies to inſtruct and help us to take heed what we hear.</p>
                  <p>But it will not be ſo taken by all; for the Churches Remedy is the Sectaries Diſeaſe, who complain, That by this means the <hi>liberty of the Spirit</hi> and of the <hi>Conſcience</hi> are penn'd up in thoſe Forms; and, which is a worſe miſchief, if it were true, a binding of God's Word, which ought to be free: But for that God's Word neither is nor can be bound. The Forms are no more but the gathering together ſome of thoſe Waters which flow all over the Scriptures, into a ſtream, to fit them for the eaſe and uſe of all. But they ſay, they take a better courſe to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:32545:47"/>fetch all from the Fountain. The Fountain indeed is purer; but I ſee no reaſon why the Water ſhould be purer in their <hi>Pitchers</hi> than in the Churches <hi>Stream,</hi> ſeeing both claim immediately to the ſame Fountain.</p>
                  <p>They ſay again, That theſe Forms are no better than <hi>ſnares,</hi> to hinder many a painful Preacher of the Goſpel. They would ſeem careful to unbind God's Word; but I ſee it is to ſet themſelves at liberty. As for painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Preaching, if it be not to ſome good purpoſe, I ſhall not much reckon upon.</p>
                  <p>The Phariſees <hi>compaſſed Sea and Land,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23.13.</note> but it was to make Phariſees, Proſelytes of their Faction, not of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Nay, but they preach the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> The Goſpel is a glorious Word; but what Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? A Goſpel you may perhaps have enough of, and too much: S. <hi>Paul</hi> informs <hi>Timothy</hi> of <hi>perilous times to come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1.</note> when <hi>men will be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, without natural affection, truce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How think you comes it to paſs that there ſhould be ſuch a general Apoſtacy? was it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32545:48"/>not for want of preaching? They had no Sermons, or perhaps no great affection for them; they were ſome cold hearers, that were content with one Sermon a day. No, that was not the matter; if we read on to the next Chapter we ſhall find they had hearing enough; for they were ſuch as <hi>heap'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Teachers,</hi> and ſo had heaps of Sermons, and affection for them too; for they had itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ears. What was it then? They could not away with <hi>ſound Doctrine,</hi> but would have Teachers after their own luſts; they had the Goſpel in plenty, but it was <hi>Evangelium</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; after their own luſts, not of <hi>ſound Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is ſound Doctrine? S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay here, becauſe a little before he had given <hi>Timothy</hi> a form of it, <hi>Keep the Form of ſound words which thou haſt heard from me;</hi> and becauſe their Goſpel did not agree to that, he chargeth him to <hi>avoid it.</hi> So ſhould we do too with ſuch a Goſpel as will not ſtand within our form of wholeſom words: Or if it be ſuch as was preached here for twenty years together, we have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be fond of it, or any pains that is taken about it. If they will not hear the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32545:48"/>Churches Goſpel, what reaſon hath the Church to hear theirs?</p>
                  <p>To end my firſt point, If it was wiſdom in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to commend a form of words, and in the whole Catholick Church to uſe one; if the ſame was practis'd by every reformed Church, and all that people might with peace and ſecurity know what to hear: I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what wiſdom it can be to lay all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon again for any mans pleaſure; for this is to <hi>legitimate</hi> Schiſm, and entail diviſion to the Church for ever. As you love your ſelves, your quiet, and look to receive benefit by the immortal ſeed of Gods Word, if you would be good Chriſtians, that is, be adviſed by Chriſt, and in that way which all Chriſtians have uſed, to <hi>Take heed what you hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WE come now to the ſecond point of our care, <hi>Take heed how you hear,</hi> and this no leſs neceſſary than the former; for when we have provided for the Matter what we hear, we may yet offend in the Manner <hi>how;</hi> and ſo loſe the benefit of both.</p>
                  <p>That which is here ſet down in proper words, is by our Saviour illuſtrated in a Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>Is a candle brought to be put
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32545:49"/>under a buſhel, or under a bed, and not to be ſet on a Candleſtick?</hi> that is, and ſo St. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſes it, A candle is not brought to be put under a Buſhel, but to be ſet on a Candleſtick. This makes two points in the manner of our hearing, one <hi>negative,</hi> that we do not ſo hear Gods Word that we put it under a Buſhel, another <hi>affirmative,</hi> that we ſet it on a Candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> Gods Word is a light, we can do nothing more contrary to light than to hide it, to put it under a Buſhel, <hi>i.e.</hi> to do any thing that will intercept the light and benefit of it. Now this may be done ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By perverting the proper end and uſe of hearing. Hearing Gods word is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a good point of Religion; for it is a duty commanded, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>If any man have ears to hear let him hear;</hi> yet if he hear as he ſhould, he muſt not miſtake one kind of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for another. Duties are of divers kinds, ſome <hi>eſſential</hi> parts of Religion, ſome <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> and ſome <hi>both.</hi> The two chief du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this time, faſting and hearing, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental onely. That Faſting is ſo, we learn from St. <hi>Paul. The Kingdom of Heaven is not meat and drink,</hi> i.e. conſiſts not in it;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32545:49"/>yet if well uſed is a help to it. <hi>Inſtrumenti vis in uſu conſiſtit.</hi> If faſting attains not the end and uſe of it, it is good for nothing, not to be reckon'd in the order of Religious duties. So hearing Gods Word, if it work no amendment in us, is but a Cypher alone that ſtands for nothing, no better than a Candle under a Buſhel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> When hearing is not it ſelf, doth not the own duty, we are extreamly miſtaken if we make it ſerve for any other. Hearing doth edifie, help to the building, but as an <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not as Stone and Timber, the <hi>eſſential</hi> parts of it. The Ax and the Hammer, the Square and the Level, are inſtruments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can be no building: but we would think him mad that ſhould therefore lay them in the Walls or the Foundation: They are as much guilty of folly, who make their <hi>ordinary</hi> worſhip of God to be nothing but to go hear the Sermon; yea, and the <hi>extraordinary,</hi> a ſolemn Faſt and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hear a Sermon; A publick Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to hear a Sermon, and that is all. If any buſineſs extraordinary fall out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we think fit by our Devotion to ingage Gods bleſſing and protection, all we do for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32545:50"/>his ſake we ſit and hear a Sermon. If the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doth the work of an inſtrument it is well, to fit and enable us to perform thoſe duties, it ſelf is neither ſtick nor ſtone in the Building. We muſt not think all is done when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is done.</p>
                  <p>Inſtruments are of an <hi>indifferent nature,</hi> may be well or ill uſed; ſo are not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, as Faith, Repentance, and Charity, are conſtantly the ſame. Faſting, I ſaid was an inſtrumental duty, and ſo was as well us'd for ſtrife and debate, as for Humiliation and Repentance. We may remember many of thoſe fighting Faſts. <hi>He that hew'd Timber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the thick Trees was known to bring it to an excellent work;<note place="margin">Pſal. 74.</note> but now they break down all the carved works thereof with Axes and Hammers,</hi> that is, with the ſame tools that built it. As Sermons are inſtruments to build up, at another time they pull down as faſt. It is therefore very neceſſary we take heed how we hear them.</p>
                  <p>As we muſt not miſtake in the kind of the duty, an inſtrumental for an eſſential; ſo nor in the kind of the Inſtrument: for ſome are <hi>natural,</hi> as the eye is of ſeeing, the ear of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; theſe naturally do their work. Others
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32545:50"/>
                     <hi>poſitive</hi> of Divine Inſtitution, which have no vertue or power but from that; and ſuch are the Sacraments. I confeſs I never heard any ſay, that hearing of Gods Word was a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Faith: yet I know there is more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue aſcrib'd to it than natural, and by ſome more than Sacramental; for no Sacrament they think effectual without a Sermon.</p>
                  <p>If there be a miſtake in the manner and <hi>kind</hi> of operation in the Inſtrument, it will prove another putting the Candle under a Buſhel. I hope you will not think it a fruitleſs curioſity to enquire a little farther into it.</p>
                  <p>Hearing and Preaching both, for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go together, are ſo proper to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that by them it is diſtinguiſhed from the Law; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> arguing for the Chriſtian Faith againſt the Jewiſh, calls it the Hearing of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>He that miniſtreth to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and worketh miracles among you, doth he it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> The like propriety in the Goſpel hath preaching; for whatſoever way the wiſdom of the world may take, <hi>It pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. And thus by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction the Goſpel is call'd <hi>the miniſtration
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32545:51"/>of the Spirit,</hi> becauſe preached by inſpiration of the Spirit, and the Law the miniſtration of the Letter, becauſe given in writing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who hath made us Miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>not of the Letter, but of the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But was there then no hearing nor preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Law? That cannot be ſaid nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives, let them hear them.</hi> And the <hi>Prieſt's lips</hi> could not <hi>preſerve knowledge</hi> unleſs it were received from his mouth by hearing. It was commonly practiſed in the Synagogues after the reading of the Law in the time of the Apoſtles to exhort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his company went into the Synagogue at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> they were deſired to give the people <hi>a word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13.15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>How then comes it to paſs that by hearing and preaching, the Chriſtian Religion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Jews, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both? And why is the Law call'd the miniſtration of the <hi>Letter,</hi> by way of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing the Goſpel is <hi>written</hi> as well as the Law?</p>
                  <p>'Tis plain that theſe things are ſpoken, not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32545:51"/>
                     <hi>ſimply,</hi> and univerſally of either, but in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their beginning and <hi>firſt</hi> publiſhing to the world. Becauſe the Law was then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by writing, though afterwards preached; it is called the miniſtration of the Letter: So the Goſpel, though afterwards written, yet becauſe it was then only preached by revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt, it is call'd the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>That likewiſe which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>hearing of Faith,</hi> and of ſaving men by the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of preaching hath a peculiar relation to Chriſtianity in the manner of founding it at firſt. For certainly Preaching in it ſelf was not in the eye of humane wiſdom a fooliſh way to perſwade, but ſuch as the wiſeſt of them all uſed: when they would perſwade the people any thing, they did it by orations and ſpeeches, which are of the ſame kind with preaching.</p>
                  <p>But if we look at that preaching by which the Chriſtian Religion was at firſt introduced, it had in the eye of humane wiſdom ſomething of folly in it. For to introduce a Law or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to any people, theſe <hi>two</hi> things among others are neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>That they give it in <hi>Writing,</hi> that they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32545:52"/>might more certainly know what they had to do, and that it be by ſuch as have <hi>authority</hi> and power. And this way God himſelf took in giving the Jews a Law: for <hi>firſt,</hi> he wrote it with his own fingers, and then publiſhed it by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> who was their leader and governour.</p>
                  <p>But for the introduction of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it pleaſed God to take a far different courſe, that is, to commit all to the preaching of a few poor deſpicable Fiſher-men, who were only private men, of no authority; and of whoſe Goſpel they had no knowledge, but from what was to be taken from their mouths. And that when firſt preached, was by ſome eſteemed no better than a diſtemper, yea, plain drunkenneſs: yet, thus it pleaſed God to put the words of eternal life into theſe earthen veſſels, and by that means to make his own power known, and by that folly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wiſdom of the world.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>our</hi> preaching, though it may have many times too good a title to fooliſhneſs in preaching, yet not to the fooliſhneſs of preaching: for, thoſe obſtacles remov'd, it is the ordinary way by which all knowledge, humane as well as divine is communicated:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32545:52"/>My meaning is, that <hi>hearing</hi> now is to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the common <hi>natural</hi> inſtrument to receive inſtruction, and therefore no benefit to be reckon'd on from it, but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all other learning and knowledge, that is, by ſerious ſtudying, and diligently pondering the things we hear; for if we truſt to any ſecret, ſacramental, myſtical vertue in hearing: that profit we ſhould get by the Word we may loſe by the Hearing. Therefore <hi>take heed</hi> how <hi>you hear;</hi> for this is a ſecond way of putting Gods word under a Buſhel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> There is another way, which in part at leaſt puts under the Buſhel too, when we <hi>confine</hi> it to the <hi>Sermon:</hi> whereas that is of little uſe, if Gods word be not in it; they ſay, The word is of as little, if it be not in a Sermon, which is a derogation to the goodneſs and bounty of Almighty God, who hath diſpenſed his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth ſo many ways beſides: as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt by <hi>Reading;</hi> for though when Gods Word was preached only, it could be only heard; yet when it was a Scripture, it might be known, as all other Writings, by reading alſo: for this reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets <hi>Timothy</hi> to his Book,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Till I come give attendance to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Search the Scriptures, for therein you
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32545:53"/>think you have eternal life;</hi> and ſearch we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not unleſs we read them, that by reading we may find the way to eternal life: yea, though all were to be done by preaching, Reading is that too: <hi>For Moſes had in old time them that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> Acts 15.21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By <hi>writing,</hi> Gods Word works Faith in us, if S. <hi>John</hi> was not miſtaken when he ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you, that ye may know ye have eternal life, and that ye may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the name of the Son of God.</hi> Good wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are in their kind good Preachers. Why then ſhould any be ſcandalized at the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that looks upon his Book where his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is written. Indeed, if men now were to ſpeak as the Apoſtles did, <hi>as the Spirit gave them utterance,</hi> it were a great miſtake to look for him in a Book: But if we, as all muſt take Gods Word out of the Scripture; and every Preacher, if he be not too bold with God and his Auditors, that he may ſpeak from thence what is both true and ſeaſonable, prepares by writing that which he is to preach; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is the ſame in the Pulpit that it was in the ſtudy, and though the Preacher that looks in his Book be the worſe, the Sermon I am ſure is not.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:32545:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may receive the fruit of God's Word in the virtuous life and <hi>example</hi> of others; for this St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>holding forth the VVord of Life,</hi> Phil. 2.16. <hi>That ye may be blameleſs, the Sons of God, without rebuke, holding forth the VVord of Life; i. e.</hi> it is viſible and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in all our actions and demeanour. Thus a Man may be a Preacher of God's Word, though he be not in Orders: Yea, Women, that are forbidden to ſpeak in the Church, may thus convert their Husbands at home. <hi>Likewiſe, ye VVives be in ſubjection to your Husbands, that if any obey not the Word</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3 1.</note> when it is preached) <hi>they alſo may without the Word be won by the converſation of the Wife.</hi> So power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual is God's Word, that it works by example, though in the weakeſt Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> There be divers ways of preaching in the more proper ſenſe, beſides the Sermon; for preaching is either <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private,</hi> as we learn from St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20.20. where he gives account to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> of himſelf, <hi>That he had taught them publickly, and from houſe to houſe.</hi> Sure he did not make a formal Sermon in every houſe he came into, but as occaſion and opportunity
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32545:54"/>was given, by Conference he made known to them the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Again, Publick preaching is not all of a kind; for that may be, either by <hi>laying the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. which we call Catechizing. If this be not Preaching, if <hi>laying the Foundation</hi> be not edifying, we ſhall make but a ſorry Building. If this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith be not well laid, every new wind of Doctrine that riſes blows it ſtraight down again.</p>
                  <p>In theſe ſeveral ways, beſides the Sermon, is God's Word effectual. Now if we put all theſe under the buſhel, and ſet up the Sermon only, we had need take heed how we hear that; for if that wherein all our hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence lies ſhould go under the buſhel too, we are in a ſad caſe.</p>
                  <p>It will therefore neerly concern us to take heed, That God's Word be not loſt in the Sermon, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the <hi>power</hi> of it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the evident conviction of truth, be not loſt in formalities and impertinences, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly us'd in Sermons.</p>
                  <p>As when little regard is given by ſome to God's Word, unleſs the Sermon preſents it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32545:54"/>ſelf dreſs'd up with all the curioſities of Art, Language, and Phanſie too; which ſometimes ſo diſguiſes it, as it can hardly be known from a <hi>Poem.</hi> But for the true uſe of Ornaments of Art and Speech, if they make us love our duties the more, as they make us more in love with hearing, I ſhould think it well beſtow'd. But if painted Sermons be like painted Glaſs, that makes' a Room beautiful, but intercepts too much the light, it may well go in the rank too of thoſe things which put God's Word under the buſhel.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is done too with a courſer ſort of Forms, which have no title to be <hi>divine,</hi> but that they <hi>want humane</hi> Learning. And yet if God's Word be not in that jejune formal dreſs, it will not be ſo kindly received by thoſe who out of a ſeeming tenderneſs of the liberty of God's Word, are afraid that the Churches Form ſhould bind it, and ſpare not to fetter it in cold formalities of their own, in which it languiſheth to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Again, God's Word muſt needs be put under a buſhel, when it is put <hi>into</hi> the buſhel; I mean, when it is heard by <hi>Meaſure;</hi> I do not mean the meaſure of Faith here in the Text, the meaſure of the Sanctuary; but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32545:55"/>the common Market-meaſure; as when we muſt have an Hour-glaſs full at leaſt, and ſomwhat running over, to make a juſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; though the particulars be as incoherent both with the Text and themſelves, as the <hi>ſand</hi> that meaſures them; yet if it runs on ſmoothly, and fills up the time, all is well.</p>
                  <p>There is as little good from Sermons when they are heard by <hi>Tale;</hi> if we have not our full number, as well as our full meaſure, two at the leaſt a day, the poor people are ſtarv'd.</p>
                  <p>They would pity my ſimplicity, if I ſhould take upon me to confute it out of vain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and tell them out of it, That <hi>quantitatis nulla eſt efficacia:</hi> I ſhall, with their good leaves,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.1.</note> from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (out of the place I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before) to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſhew them, That there is no efficacy in <hi>quantity:</hi> What a bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll of ſins doth he lay at their doors that heap to themſelves Teachers? There was a heap of ſins under a heap of Sermons. And no wonder; for being after their own luſt, the more commonly the worſe.</p>
                  <p>There be many other things to be taken heed of in hearing, which intercept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the light of God's Word: But becauſe the time wears away, I will add but one more.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:32545:55"/>
                  <p>That out of ignorance or ill will we do <hi>not miſconſtrue</hi> what we hear; as St. <hi>Peter</hi> obſerv'd ſome to do with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, which they <hi>wreſted to their own deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this I rather add in my own defence, leſt that which is ſpoken in favour of hearing, ſhould be interpreted a diſcouragement to it; becauſe people generally are not ſo well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they ſhould be to ſo good a duty, who had more need of fire to heat them, than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool them.</p>
                  <p>It had been to better purpoſe, you will ſay, if I had taken my Text out of St. <hi>James; Be ſwift to hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I beſeech you not to be miſtaken. That which hath been ſaid doth not take us off our ſpeed: We may be ſtill as ſwift to hear as our Zeal can carry us. It puts us only in our right way, that we <hi>do not run in vain.</hi> It is only to take God's Word from under the buſhel, where it doth no good; that we may ſet it on the candleſtick, from whence we may receive the light of it, and in that the benefit of our Saviour's advice, to <hi>take heed how we hear;</hi> which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of our care in the affirmative, by ſetting Gods VVord on the candleſtick.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:32545:56"/>
                  <p>TO ſet God's VVord on the Candleſtick, is to ſet it where we may receive the light of it; and that is, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> By a <hi>particular</hi> uſe and application of it to our ſelves that hear; for though Preachers have commonly theſe words in their Sermons, Uſes, and Application, and they know beſt why they uſe them, I do not; for ſure I am, they are more proper to the Hearers. The Preacher gives the Doctrine, but the Hearers muſt make the Uſe and Application. No Preacher can ſay, as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art the Man;</hi> unleſs he have a ſpecial Commiſſion, as he had from God. No Preacher hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to our Conſciences; at that Bar every man muſt be his own Judge and VVitneſs, and as there ſhall be cauſe, pronounce Sentence againſt himſelf, <hi>Thou art the Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we ſit at the Sermon as men unconcern'd for any thing but the hearing of it, to us it is all one as if it had been ſtill under the Buſhel, and not upon the Candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>If we hear, and make no uſe of it, we leave out the beſt part of the Sermon; for the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers make bad Sermons, as well as Preachers.</p>
                  <p>But when a fault or error is reprehended, muſt every Hearer pronounce himſelf guilty!
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:32545:56"/>Certainly No; for that were injuſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the innocent. Though the Sermon condemns not every man that hears it, yet it puts every man upon his trial, to let the light into his own boſom, to ſee whether he be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or not. If guilty, let him do as guilty men do, ſue for mercy, and pardon, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If not guilty, let him enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of that, <hi>If our heart condemns us not, then have we confidence towards God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.21. And <hi>happy is he that condemneth not himſelf,</hi> Rom. 14.22. Guilty, or not guilty, we have benefit by the light that actually ſhines upon us; for ſo it doth in the Candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> A light in a Candleſtick <hi>inlightens</hi> every one <hi>alike</hi> that comes into the room. If a light be brought to us which none can ſee but he that brings it, it may very well be ſuſpected to be none of God's Lights, becauſe it will not ſtand in a Candleſtick, ſo as to be ſeen by others. And many ſuch there be, who muſt be allowed to hold ſpecial intelligence with God, and by private illumination from the Spirit, ſee clearer and farther into the darkeſt Myſteries than any of the Doctors or <hi>Rabbies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They put me in mind of ſome, though not the beſt ſort of Creatures, yet in the dark ſee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32545:57"/>better than others; as the <hi>Owle,</hi> the Cat, and the Bat: of which I have known <hi>Philoſophers</hi> give this reaſon: That rays of light do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſtream from their eyes, by which the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> and Air about is inlightned; This at beſt, if there be any ſuch, is a light which none ſees but themſelves. Now if thoſe illuminated ſeers be ſuch that their light is not where Gods Word ſhould be in a Candleſtick, where it may be ſeen of all, it is indeed no better than <hi>Owles light</hi> that ſhines only out of their own eyes.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> Light will pierce through where no Sword can go, at the leaſt hole and creviſe. If all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of greateſt ſecrecy receive not light and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from Gods Word, we do not ſet it in

It ſhews not only the end of all eternal reſt and happineſs, but is a light unto the paths that lead to it. It holds us not only upon the gaze of the glory and joys of Heaven, but carries us through the darker myſteries of faith, and the more unpleaſing ways of Repentance and Mortification. The Goſpel is not <hi>the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> unleſs it be alſo the power of God upon all the ſteps and degrees to it.

It is a word of inſtruction, a word of exhortation, a word of comfort, a word of reproof, a word of promiſe, and a word of command, and ſo ſerves us in all our neceſſities. It inſtructs the ignorant, corrects the obſtinate, comforts the dejected, dejects the proud, quiets the paſſions, invites by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, binds by commands.</p>
                  <p>If we pick and chuſe, lay hold on the word
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32545:58"/>of conſolation, not of correction; of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not of commands. We take the light as men do out of a <hi>dark</hi> Lanthorn, from one ſide only, no more than looks towards our private ends and intereſt.

                  <p>So much difference we ſee there is between Gods Word in a Candleſtick, and under a Buſhel; and how much benefit comes by the one, and how little by the other. If we take not heed to this, we fall into the common, but dangerous error. That when we have heard the Sermon, we have done our duty for that time, though we neither heed what or how we hear. And yet according to that only, Sermons are, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of them in the perſon of the Preacher, <hi>A ſavour of life,</hi> or <hi>a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death.</hi> As the <hi>evil ſervant</hi> was judg'd out of his own mouth, ſo ſhall the careleſs hearer out of his own ears.

That which went next before is, <hi>We beſeech you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe more and more. We beſeech you,</hi> is that we are to take into the Text, and then it runs thus, <hi>We beſeech you to ſtudy to be quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all the uſe I ſhall make of it, now we have it here, is but to give you a taſte before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the nature and quality of this duty, That it is no trivial thing little to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that which obliged S. <hi>Paul, Sylvanus,</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:32545:60"/>and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> for they all joyn'd in it, to be ſo earneſt, as to beſeech them to ſtudy to be quiet.

And that which commends this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the more is, (as we uſe to ſay, Men are beſt known by the company they keep) <hi>And</hi> brings in this Duty in the company of the beſt of Vertues, Charity, for that place S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives it above all;<note place="margin">Col. 3.14.</note> 
                           <hi>Above all things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfection.</hi> To ſtudy to be quiet, and to increaſe in brotherly love and charity, for that led the way before, are two duties bound together in the ſame Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</item>
                        <item>3. Quiet is not only a fit companion for Charity, but an Allie to it, and grows out of it, as the branch out of the ſtock; for where brotherly love is, there will be alwayes quiet too.</item>
                        <item>4. To make all ſuit the better with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Exhortation is advanced by a Dialect of Love, <hi>VVe beſeech you. Paul, Sylvanus,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> were all Apoſtolical men, and might command, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf in another caſe to <hi>Philemon, Though I might be bold to enjoyn thee, yet for loves ſake I rather beſeech you.</hi>

And laſtly, that which might very well ſet this edge upon their affections, was, that which happened to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> at their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; for this Epiſtle was written imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32545:60"/>after. The ſtory we have in the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts:</hi> When S. <hi>Paul</hi> had preach'd the Goſpel to them, and with good ſucceſs; for <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Some of them believed, and conſorted with</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Salas, <hi>and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few,</hi> But <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>The Jews who believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baſer ſort, and gathered a company, and ſet all the City in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, and aſſaulted the houſe of</hi> Jaſon, <hi>and ſought to bring them out to the people;</hi> mad enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but the more to ferment and enrage them, they charge the Apoſtles with the fault that they themſelves were acting; <hi>Theſe are they that turn the world upſide-down.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſcaped this fury by going to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there conſidering in what a caſe he left his new Converts, both them and their Doctrine; them in a furious tumult, and their Doctrine under the reproach of troubling the world; out of a zeal, no doubt, and deſire to remove that ſcandal from the Faith, of all things begs and beſeecheth them to <hi>ſtudy to be quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how will this concern us? I wiſh we never had, and had not ſtill the ſame occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is not ſo long ſince, that we ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get how our late troubles firſt brake in upon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32545:61"/>our quiet: We had unbelieving Jews then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us too, and ſome, as was thought, in the literal ſenſe; who moved with envy of the times, took unto them likewiſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of lewd fellows of the baſer ſort, ſet the City in an uproar; and we may remember whoſe houſes they beſet (as the Jews did <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>) none of the meaneſt, and cried out for that juſtice which themſelves deſerved. And there were Religions in the world then too many, to the ſcandal of the true, who led on, and blew up thoſe tumults: And even now, though (God be thanked) they dare not be ſo bold to aſſault us in the ſtreets, and beſet our houſes as they did then; yet ſtill keep their quarters and leaguers within doors, with more ſecreſie, but no leſs danger.</p>
                  <p>It will not therefore be unſeaſonable for us now, who have the ſame cauſe the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> had, with the ſame affection the Apoſtle did, to beſeech you to <hi>ſtudy to be quiet.</hi> We have all need of quiet, and quiet it ſeems hath need of ſtudy, and ſtudy hath need of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and therefore before we proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Let us pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:32545:61"/>
                  <p>THe parts of the Text are two; <hi>VVhat</hi> we are to ſtudy, And <hi>That</hi> we are to ſtudy. Firſt, What? <hi>That ye ſtudy to be quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quiet is here commended under the notion and quality of an Art or Science; for we are injoyned to ſtudy it. And in them we are to look, firſt, to the object, the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it; and then to the Principles and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems</hi> whereon the Art is grounded.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the nature and kind of this Quiet firſt: For there be many things lay claim to this word, which are either unfit for our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or improper to this place. As firſt, there is a quiet from all motion or action that is good or uſeful; to do nothing but eat and drink and ſleep, or worſe; Away with that quiet; it neither deſerves our ſtudy, nor needs it. This is <hi>Negotioſa quies;</hi> we are commanded in the words following to be buſie as well as qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; we are both to ſtudy to be quiet, and to do our own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a Quiet, not ſimply from all, but <hi>publick</hi> buſineſs; when men retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for private ſtudy or devotion. This may be allowed, and commended too, when the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of their Countries requires them not.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32545:62"/>But becauſe publick imployments are ſeldome forced upon any, nor need to be; for no mans parts or abilities are ſo great, which may not truly, and certainly will be thought ſuch as can very well be ſpared. They therefore who affect that privacy, may be ſecure from that neceſſity; they who have a will to be quiet for devotion or ſtudy, need not ſtudy to be quiet, the acceſs to that is eaſie enough.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is another Quiet, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in its ſelf, and needs our ſtudy too; To compoſe our unruly and diſordered <hi>paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and affections, which raiſe tumults and commotions within us, that will not ſuffer us to be at reſt or quiet day or night. In the midſt therefore of all the temptations of good, or ſtorms of ill fortune to reſt ſecurely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, whatſoever happens to our private, is certainly an admirable temper, and well worthy our beſt care and ſtudy; and was that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf it ſeems ſtudied, for he ſaid he learned it;<note place="margin">Phil. 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>I have learned in what eſtate ſoever I am, therewith to be content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the quiet we are here to ſtudy is not properly within us, but without us; it is not ſimply a quiet from motion, but commotion, a troubling of others.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:32545:62"/>
                  <p n="4">4. And that I may contract my argument and bring it into as narrow a compaſs as may be, I ſhall not take in every of the diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the quiet of others: No not that which is the greateſt of all, and moſt contrary to peace and quiet, <hi>Civil Wars</hi> and broils. The miſchiefs of that we have learned ſo lately to our coſt, and ſo perfectly, that I hope we need not be ſet to ſtudy that now: when every good man was put to his ſtudy how to live, and when vile and contemptible wretches ranted in plenty and power.</p>
                  <p>The horrid fruits and conſequences of that great diſturber of quiet, <hi>War,</hi> have induc'd ſome learned men as well as others to think all wars unlawful; I ſhould have been much inclined to that opinion upon the ſtricteſt rules of Chriſtianity, if War were not ſometimes neceſſary to Peace. A <hi>foreign</hi> War for that reaſon may be lawful, but a <hi>civil</hi> and domeſtick never. And the reaſon of this difference is, becauſe for the compoſing of all quarrels that may ariſe between ſubjects, God hath by his Ordinance provided a remedy in <hi>Princes</hi> and Magiſtrates, from whom alone we are to ſeek for revenge or defence. But for ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as ariſe between free Princes and States,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32545:63"/>becauſe there is no Judg on earth, to whom they may have recourſe for their relief, being deſtitute of the common remedy, they may, without queſtion, make uſe of that ſword which God hath put into their hands to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their ſubjects from the injuries as well of ſtrangers as their own. Nor are they in this Judges in their own cauſe, which hath ſome appearance of injuſtice; for a foreign War, for defect of a competent Judg on Earth, is but an <hi>appeal</hi> to the ſupreme Judg of Heaven and Earth. And when they go into the Field, it is but to plead their cauſe before God, with whom are the iſſues of War. Only they had need be careful, that the cauſe they bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him be good; For <hi>ſhall not the Judg of all the world do right?</hi> But we muſt leave this to Princes and their Miniſters, who are the only proper ſtudents of that quiet, which is diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by War, and come to that which may and muſt be the ſtudy of us all: That is, <hi>a quiet from troubles that ariſe from different judgments and perſwaſions in matters of Religion,</hi> which cauſe ſects and diviſions in it, though they break not out into an open War. Not that War be quite left out of the Sectaries reckoning. For though Civil Wars and Rebellions have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32545:63"/>their beginning for the moſt part from the ambition or diſcontent of a few, yet becauſe the people, who are the neceſſary inſtruments of that miſchief, be not apt to ſerve the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, if it comes bare-faced to them, the mask of Religion is always put on, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all people are concerned, which makes it a common and popular intereſt. And therefore you ſhall ſcarce hear of a Rebellion of late times, in which Religion did not carry the <hi>Colours</hi> at leaſt, if not command in chief.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall nevertheleſs at this time forbear to make that any part of the Schiſmaticks charge, but treat them upon their own terms, that they are as great enemies to War as any that object it to them: Yet I muſt charge them all to be guilty of the breach of peace and quiet in the Church, and that not accidentally, which may ſometimes bear excuſe, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily; it is connatural and incident to the very nature of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which is a rent or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo the word ſignifies. It is the worſt diſturbance that can be to any body, to be torn in pieces. It diſſolves the bonds by which the parts are joyned together, eſpecially that which unites them to the Head; for <hi>ſchiſm</hi> in the Churches notion is properly a ſeparation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32545:64"/>from the Head and authority, and is the ſame in the Church that Rebellion or Treaſon is in the State. Now as every diſobedience to the King and the Law is not Treaſon, though againſt the King, but the diſclaiming the <hi>right</hi> and power the King hath to govern, and the practice of ſuch things, by which his <hi>Regalia</hi> and rights are uſurpt by others, as to make War, to make Laws, to thruſt Officers upon him, to order the Coin, theſe and of the like kind are only Treaſon. So every error or diſobedience in Religion makes not a ſchiſm, but the diſclaiming the right and power the Church hath to govern them, and a uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a right to themſelves, to order and frame points of Belief, and Forms how to ſerve and worſhip God, apart from the Church, for ſo went the ſtyle of the ancient Church for Schiſm, <hi>altare contra altare,</hi> which in our modern dialect is a <hi>Conventicle</hi> againſt the <hi>Church.</hi> For though Schiſm be formally a ſeparation from the Head, yet conſequently it works upon the members; for that which was at firſt but difference of opinion, ſoon begets a diſaffection, and from that grows to hatred and contempt, and ſo falls into the practice of ſuch things as deſtroy the very
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32545:64"/>being and power of Religion, which conſiſts in the mutual offices of Charity; and though this miſchief breaks not out into an actual War, yet is always accompanied with moſt unnatural and unchriſtian practices, as S. <hi>James</hi> long ſince obſerved, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Where envy and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work.</hi> Now to avoid all this, it will highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to <hi>ſtudy to be quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having cleared the firſt Point, the Object of our ſtudy, <hi>Quiet,</hi> and wherein the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of it conſiſts, and how it comes to be diſturbed by Schiſm: The next Point is, to enquire into the <hi>Principles</hi> whereon we are to ground our ſtudy; for if there ſhould be an errour or miſtake in them, all our labour and ſtudy is loſt, or worſe; for an inveterate, grounded, ſtudied errour is ſo much the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be reclaimed. It was no unreaſonable demand therefore of the Philoſopher, who asked a double reward for thoſe Scholars that had been already entred into the ſtudy of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, becauſe his pains would be double with them, to undo firſt, and caſt out thoſe falſe prejudices which they had already learned.</p>
                  <p>Now if it ſhould happen, that they which are otherwiſe ſtudious and deſirous of peace,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32545:65"/>ſhould not do <hi>the things that make for peace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14.10.</note> as the Apoſtle requires, our ſtudy will grow upon us, firſt to unlearn thoſe falſe deceitful princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of peace, before we enquire into the true: Of ſome of the chief of theſe therefore I ſhall give you an account in the firſt place. It will conduce much to the peace of the Church, they ſay, Firſt,</p>

                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But that none of all theſe are things that make for peace, I ſhall ſhew with as much brevity as the matter is capable of; as firſt.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:32545:65"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Not the <hi>forbearance of all compulſory means</hi> by puniſhments, which, they ſay, is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to that freeneſs with which Religion ſhould be entertained, and only forces men to an hypocritical obedience to that which in in their judgments they deteſt.</p>
                  <p>Religion, I grant, ſhould be free; it is no Religion which is not ſo; But it is as true, that every other act of vertue, and obedience to the Laws ſhould be free likewiſe; but therefore not to puniſh them that tranſgreſs, were to proclaim a perpetual <hi>Jubile,</hi> and ſet open all priſon doors: God would never have enjoyned the Magiſtrate to puniſh temporally, nor himſelf threatned to puniſh eternally, if the fear of that did corrupt our obedience: For our Saviour in the <hi>Parable,</hi> when the gueſts came not to the <hi>banquet</hi> at his invitation,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.23.</note> commanded his ſervants to <hi>compel them to come in.</hi> And where they ſay, the fruit of that is but hypocriſie; Hypocrites they are like enough to be, but from a worſe cauſe, not from the puniſhment, but their own frailties, becauſe they prefer their temporal ſafety before the eternal bleſſing which Chriſt hath promiſed to all that ſuffer for his ſake and the truth. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> It is true, that puniſhments reach not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32545:66"/>directly the inward man, nor do they teach or inform the Judgment, that is, they do not perfect the work; but are nevertheleſs a good beginning to it: For, <hi>Fear is the beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> which <hi>Love</hi> muſt <hi>perfect.</hi> Though the <hi>Needle</hi> ſtays not in the Garment, yet it muſt lead the Thred that makes it up. The Rod indeed doth not teach the child, yet ſcares him to his book where he may learn: So though puniſhments do not perfect and accompliſh our duty, yet they ſet us to our ſtudies, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that we do not raſhly caſt our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on danger, which otherwiſe poſſibly we would never think off, but run on whither our wild vain fancies and groundleſs perſwaſions led us: For <hi>Spes impunitatis eſt illecebra peccandi.</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments therefore are both juſtified for the good they do, and are abſolved from the evil they are pretended to do; and therefore wholly to forbear them in matters of Religion is no good principle whereon to ground the Churches peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The next is, <hi>That howſoever it be in other matters of Religion, it would make much for the quiet of the Church, if Errors in Judgment were not puniſhed as crimes, becauſe no man can be abler and wiſer than God hath made him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:32545:66"/>
                  <p>It is true, that an Error, ſo long as it ſtays in the Underſtanding, and goes no further is not properly a ſin; for the Underſtanding is not <hi>agens liberum,</hi> but paſſive. In that the eye of the mind is as the eye of the body; if that be naturally ſhort-ſighted, it is no fault that it ſees not ſo far as another: But if the weakneſs of the Underſtanding participate with the Will, which is <hi>agens liberum,</hi> and ſo the Error comes within our power, then it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a ſin. This is the caſe of all that diſſent in <hi>Sects;</hi> for though in <hi>ſpeculation</hi> the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is diſtinct from the Will, yet in <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> they are ſeldom ſevered. For it is morally impoſſible, that after a man hath conceived an opinion, he ſhould not be well pleaſed with it, and have a will as occaſion is to defend and propagate it too. And when it is <hi>Voluntarium,</hi> no doubt but it is <hi>Peccatum,</hi> and when error grows to be a ſin, I know no reaſon why it may not be puniſhed; for <hi>intereſt reipublicae pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata puniri.</hi> But for all that it is, they ſay, a great diſturbance of quiet to be tied to aſſent to that we cannot know nor comprehend. That's a great miſtake. I know there is much exception taken to the too punctual <hi>deſinitions</hi> of ſome myſteries of the faith, and particularly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32545:67"/>in the Creed commonly called by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> where there are many particulars which they cannot know nor comprehend. Whereas in truth it is not required of them, they are not bound to <hi>know</hi> them, but to <hi>believe</hi> them; for it is the mercy of God, that the defect of our knowledg may be ſupplyed by the knowledg of others; for to believe is to ſee with other mens eyes, as knowledg is with our own.</p>
                  <p>But may we ſafely <hi>truſt</hi> others in that which ſo neerly concerns as a <hi>Creed?</hi> Yes ſure, and it is as well the mercy, as the command of God, that we ſhould truſt thoſe that watch over our ſouls; yet ſtill that muſt be to ſupply the defect of our knowledg, not otherwiſe; for the Church is not Lord of our Faith, but helper of our Ignorance. It ſupplies the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our ſight, it doth not put it out: for if a man knows the contrary, he is not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve others; for if he can ſee with his own eyes, why ſhall he be tied to ſee with other mens?</p>
                  <p>But then we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt not knowing the <hi>negative,</hi> and a <hi>poſitive</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary: for if we refuſe to believe meerly becauſe we do not know or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we leave no place for Faith at all, which is the benefit to ſee by others. And for that,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32545:67"/>poſitive knowledg which diſcharges us of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving others that we be not miſtaken, it is not every conjectural or probable perſwaſion will do it, but certain knowledg: and when that is, we may ſafely learn from the Schools; <hi>Ubi non eſt for mido contrarii,</hi> after diligent ſearch and enquiry, when there remains no ſcruple, doubt, or fear of the contrary, when the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is fixed, we are ſaid to be certain.</p>
                  <p>If this knowledge will ſerve to diſcharge us of believing others, every one that diſſents will ſay he knows the contrary, yea, and if need be will ſwear to it too; for that's an expedient lately found out to obtain that <hi>liberty,</hi> That they may be admitted to ſwear they know the contrary to that which is commanded. Truly, if they will ſay it, and think ſo too, whether they ſwear it or no, I think we may ſafely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them from the guilt of diſobedience: but that muſt be <hi>in foro Conſcientiae</hi> only, and let them make the beſt uſe they can of that; yet <hi>in foro externo</hi> we cannot; for there the Judge muſt give ſentence according to <hi>his</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and not according to the knowledge of the <hi>party,</hi> if he will do juſtice. And that courſe can be no good friend to Peace, which is an enemy to Juſtice.</p>

                  <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, That they who object this, are not to be truſted with the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of ſins, for we know how the Market went for them when they held the Scale: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the King and the Laws, and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God according to them, were the great ſcandalous crimes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Allowing it to be true as they ſay, That omiſſion of Forms and Ceremonies is by the Church more frequently and ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then <hi>greater</hi> faults. But how greater? It may be in their <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> guilt and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity, according to which ſentence ſhall be given at the day of Judgment, and to death eternal. But our earthly Tribunals are not erected to anticipate the day of Judgment, to bring all ſinners to trial for whatſoever they have committed in the fleſh, and according to the proper <hi>meaſure</hi> of their guilt; but for a particular end and <hi>uſe;</hi> that people, while they live here in the world, and in ſociety, may be kept in good order and quiet, from doing or receiving injuries. And to this end
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32545:68"/>is the degree of their puniſhments commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate: Treaſon and Rebellion are more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed in the State then many other hainous crimes, becauſe they deſtroy the very foundation of government and Society. And for the ſame reaſon, a ſchiſmatical diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though but in matters of Form and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, is purſued with more care and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it deſtroys the very end for which the power is given the Church to puniſh, which is, the preſervation of peace and unity.</p>
                  <p>For though the Paſtors of the Church may and muſt by way of <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> the better to prepare us for our account at the great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgment, give every ſin the proper weight and meaſure of guilt, that is by way of <hi>Inſtruction:</hi> But by way of <hi>Correction</hi> the Church is bound up to certain cauſes, and if they keep not their bounds, they ſhall be ſure to hear of a <hi>prohibition;</hi> and thoſe cauſes are eſpecially ſuch, for which the power is only given, That the peaceable orderly Worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God be not diſturbed.</p>
                  <p>For though they are ever telling us, it is for trifles, ceremonies, or <hi>indifferent</hi> things, it is but the ſame quarrel the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> have againſt God himſelf, for being ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32545:69"/>for an <hi>Apple,</hi> a trifle which ſcarce any man that hath an Orchard would have been troubled with; and one Anſwer will ſerve both in effect. In that forbidden fruit, Gods authority in commanding, and <hi>Adams</hi> duty in obeying, were <hi>ſymbolically</hi> engaged for him and his, and there was venome enough in that to infect both. The Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, in like manner, though not in like degree, though in their opinion as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as the <hi>paring</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> apple, yet when diſcord and diſobedience is found with them, there is poyſon enough in that for the ſtrongeſt antidote the Church doth at any time make uſe of. Let not that therefore miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead or diſturb our Student of Quiet.</p>

                  <p>It is fit, I grant, the Church-door ſhould ſtand always open, but for ſuch as ſhall be fit to enter; for it would be a dangerous thing to ſet any door ſo wide open to let in an enemy upon us. But to what purpoſe would we have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32545:69"/>the Church-door ſo wide, when the Gate of Heaven is ſtrait? why ſhould they be taken in here, if they ſhall be turned back there? The Church is a City, as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a City that is at unity in it ſelf; ſo it is a City too that hath gates and walls to ſhut out others.</p>
                  <p>He that came to a <hi>little</hi> City, where there was a great Gate, merrily warned the Citizens to take heed leſt their City went not out at the Gate, may ſoberly be ſaid to thoſe that would have the Church-door ſo wide to let in all Sects, to take heed leſt the Church gets not out at the door: For where ſo many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, it may be feared, that ſoon there will be none at all. If we be not, as the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, built up in the ſame Faith, it will avail us little to be found within the ſame walls.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a perverſe remedy for peace, to abate or diminiſh the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>definitions</hi> of the Church, which were made of purpoſe to take away controverſies; it would be a ſtrange courſe to end controverſies, to take away the definitions.

                     <hi>Moderation,</hi> I confeſs, is an excellent vertue, and much to be deſired; <hi>Let your moderation be known unto all men,</hi> Phil. 4.5. But then it muſt be in a ſubject capable of it, wherein there are extremes and exceſſes to be moderated, as there is certainly in our paſſions, there it is proper. S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives it for a Leſſon to all Students in Religion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.31. <hi>Let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another, and tender-hearted, forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you.</hi> This no doubt is a very fit temper for quiet, and none more unfit then angry, waſpiſh, and domineering ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Only this caution is to be obſerved in lenity, That it be ſuch as may win men into the Church, not ſuch as may ſecure and encourage them to ſtay without. Yet lenity and gentleneſs is ſo good a Vertue, that I am loth to caſt water upon it, or ſeem to temper it.</p>
                  <p>But for men of moderate opinions, I am
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32545:70"/>at a loſs to know what they ſhould be; for moderation there cannot be, but between ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams: Now what extreams are there of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in a ſetled Church, unleſs the <hi>Church</hi> be one extream, and the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> another? and then the man of moderate opinions is he that is part Church-man, and part Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. I hope none are ſo unkind to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, to charge extremities upon her Doctrine or Laws. If there be any ſuch, they are but <hi>Hybrides</hi> in Religion, and make a new ſect in the Church, as pernicious to the peace of it as any of the reſt. The truth is, moderate opinions are a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> a phanſie; either nothing, or ſomewhat worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for poſſibly they may beſtow that good word (Moderation) upon ſuch as care little either to obſerve the <hi>Law</hi> themſelves, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of others. If theſe be the men of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate opinions, I wonder how they will be able to give account of their juſtice and fidelity to the <hi>truſt</hi> committed to them. Yes, they ſay, very well; It is rather prudence then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, to mitigate and ſweeten the ſharpneſs and rigour of the Law. But if the Law it ſelf be too rigorous, in God's name let it be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not left to the arbitrary power of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32545:71"/>others to do it, for that's known to be a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ten times worſe then the diſeaſe. It is ſaid in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> I know not how truly, that an error in the firſt concoction, is not mended in the ſecond: It is certainly true here, an error or exceſs in the Law, which is the firſt conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of juſtice, will be ill cured afterward by an arbitrary partiality in the execution. I hope therefore no wiſe Student of quiet, will take ſuch Moderators for the beſt Miniſters of peace. But I leave them, and come to the moſt popular, and therefore moſt dangerous principle in the ſtudy of quiet; that is, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> I have ſpoken to this point heretofore in this place; yet becauſe of late our <hi>New Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical</hi> Divines, as well as others, preſs hard for it, knowing without a free Market, they cannot vend their new bold ſpeculations; I ſhall reſume the point again a little more largely, yet within the compaſs of theſe two particulars.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, That there is a great deal of reaſon to <hi>reſtrain</hi> the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and</item>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. There is reaſon enough to <hi>reſtrain the Conſcience,</hi> for the miſchief it doth to Quiet
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32545:71"/>when it is at liberty; for all the diſcord and diviſions of the Church grow from hence, and that is a miſchief we have reaſon to avoid. <hi>Mark them</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>which cauſe diviſions among you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 16.17.</note> 
                     <hi>and avoid them.</hi> There is reaſon then to mark that which cauſeth them to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and that's the <hi>Conſcience.</hi> It is no quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Common-wealth, where it deſtroys the very Foundation of Government, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the Ordinance of God for it in Princes and Magiſtrates; for what is left for them to do, if every one muſt follow the dictate of his own Conſcience, that is, in plain terms, be bound only to obey himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This is no ſlander to the <hi>pretenders</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> they will ſay as much themſelves, if ye ask them. Ask the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> why he joyns not with the congregation of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and he will tell you, His <hi>Conſcience</hi> will not ſuffer him. Ask the <hi>Rebel</hi> in the State, why he takes up Arms to the ruine of his King and Countrey? and his <hi>Conſcience</hi> will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for him, That it is Gods cauſe, and it is to do him ſervice. Ask him again, why he doth not <hi>repent</hi> of the miſchief done by it? (for that they ſeldom do) and the Conſcience will ſerve that turn too. It is Gods cauſe, and the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32545:72"/>
                     <hi>Conſcience</hi> will not ſuffer them to repent of that. Thus we ſee, the Conſcience, as it is uſed, doth not only open a door to ſin, but ſhuts the very door to mercy, that is Repentance.</p>
                  <p>If S. <hi>John</hi> ſaid true, as no doubt he did, <hi>That there were many Antichriſts,</hi> then poſſibly the <hi>Conſcience</hi> thus improved may be one of them. For, it ſets it ſelf in the Church above all that is called God, yea, and God himſelf too, in a ſenſe; for his Laws are not to be obeyed, unleſs the <hi>Conſcience</hi> firſt allows them to be his: and thus all is reſolved into the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as the <hi>dernier reſort</hi> and laſt appeal.</p>
                  <p>While the King and the Pope are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Supremacy,</hi> the Conſcience without ſcruple puts in for it againſt both, and takes it for her right to be ſupreme in all cauſes as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil. There is great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in the world of domineering over the Conſcience; but have we not rather cauſe to complain of the domineering of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? And if any liſt to ſee the Conſcience acting all this, we need go no further then our late times, when the Conſcience was looſe for a while; one would think Hell had broke looſe, ſo fill'd was on a ſudden the Church with ſects, and the Common-wealth with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32545:72"/>confuſion. There is reaſon enough therefore to reſtrain the Conſcience that acts all this, if we knew how.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I undertook to ſhew, is, That there is <hi>no reaſon</hi> why it <hi>ſhould have liberty;</hi> and particularly, not that which gives the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt colour to it: Neither the duty we owe to <hi>Truth,</hi> which ſeems to have ſome right to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor that we owe to the <hi>Will of God,</hi> that nothing be done againſt the Conſcience. For the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Truth is that (I confeſs) which no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of peace may warrant us to deſert; for I could never be of that opinion, That Truth in ſmaller matters may for Peace ſake be either denied or prejudiced. <hi>Magna eſt veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas etiam in minimis;</hi> in Gods name let it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over all. But then it muſt be <hi>Veritas in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> not <hi>Veritas in intellectu.</hi> For though Truth be defined to be a conformity of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to <hi>the thing</hi> as it is indeed, yet takes the name from both; from the thing where Truth <hi>is originally,</hi> and from the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where it is <hi>only repreſented.</hi> Truth in that firſt reference to the thing, admits no qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; things muſt be taken as they are, be they never ſo ſmall: but as the things come to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32545:73"/>be repreſented to, and entertained by the Underſtanding, by reaſon of the miſtakes and errours that may happen in that, though Truth it ſelf, or Truth in the thing cannot, yet my apprehenſion of it may both yield to better, and may ſometimes be waved for peace ſake. To argue from Truth in the thing, to Truth in the apprehenſion only, is a fallacy againſt the Rules of Reaſoning, we call it <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> or a begging of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If a Sectary ſhould beg an alms, I wiſh he may have it; but he ſhall beg long ere it be granted him, that he hath the Truth. How then can he preſume upon that truth, to which he hath no other title but his own perſwaſion, which can be no better then any mans elſe, who is as ſtrongly perſwaded to the contrary? And this is all the ſervice that Truth can do the Conſcience for liberty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing whereupon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience eſpecially bears it ſelf ſo high, is the <hi>Will of God</hi> that nothing be done againſt the Conſcience. That no doubt is a great offence, and made ſo by the greateſt Authority: Yet the ſame God that requires our obedience to the Conſcience, commands us likewiſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey our Parents, our <hi>Princes</hi> and Governours,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:32545:73"/>and all theſe ſtand upon as good authority as the Conſcience. If we cannot reconcile our obedience to that with our obedience to theſe, we may ſin againſt God, when we do not ſin againſt the Conſcience. For though God hath erected a Tribunal in every mans breaſt, and there ſet the Conſcience to be a Judg of all our actions, there be other Tribunals of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice beſides, of Gods erection too, and to which he hath ſubjected the very Conſcience. <hi>Ye muſt needs be ſubject</hi> (Rom. 13.) <hi>not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience.</hi> And after both theſe, there is another Tribunal in Heaven, to which all Judges, Conſcience and all muſt give an account one day. For the Conſcience is no Court of Record; the Decrees and Acts paſſed there, will be no good evidence at that Bar; there all muſt be re-examined, and tried over gain. <hi>Though I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>yet am I not thereby juſtified.</hi> Though he could not charge his Conſcience with any offence, he knew a further trial muſt paſs upon him before he could be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. My Conſcience indeed may be pleaded there in evidence againſt me as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to condemn me, but not as a Judg to abſolve me. It is a great miſtake in the power
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32545:74"/>and operation of the Conſcience: That it will condemn us, if we do any thing againſt it, the Text is clear for that; but that it will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve us for that we do according to it, there is no Text, I am ſure, for that. We muſt then be tried by the Law, and not by the Conſcience: For how the proceedings will be at that Bar, we have a record, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.31. <hi>When the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him; Then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all nations.</hi> When the Court was ſet, the Charge was given to thoſe on the left hand; <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was athirſt, and ye gave me no drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye cloathed me not; ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Charge the Conſcience (no doubt confidently enough) pleaded <hi>Not guilty; Lord, when ſaw wee thee an hungred, or athirſt, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee?</hi> Their Conſcience could accuſe them of none of theſe things; for all that, the Sentence went againſt them upon a point of Law and Equity; <hi>In that ye did it not to theſe</hi> (ſaith the Judg) <hi>ye did it not to me.</hi> And for this they were condemned to eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:32545:74"/>
                  <p>If they that ſtand ſo much upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences did ſeriouſly conſider this, they would find as little cauſe to deſire that <hi>liberty,</hi> as there is to grant it, ſeeing it ſtands them in ſo little ſtead when they have moſt need of it; for when they think their conſcience ſhall anſwer for them, they muſt then anſwer for their conſcience, and upon trial, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may prove the great offender. Thus have I hitherto given you an account of ſome of the vulgar miſtaken principles of Quiet, which our Student is firſt to unlearn; which are all but the patching up of a falſe deceitful peace, condemned in the Politicks under the name of a <hi>Syncretiſmus,</hi> when all the Factions in <hi>Crete</hi> joyn'd together in a common danger, which laſted no longer then the cauſe of it: like the bonds of a hard Froſt, that binds Earth and Water, Sticks and Stones all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, till the Sun comes to ſhine upon them, and then they all preſently return to their proper place and nature again.</p>
                  <p>But I fear I have run out all my time almoſt in theſe miſtaken ways of peace: I preſume it will be a greater offence to leave you here now, then to beg a little more time to ſet you in the right way, though I ſhall not go
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:32545:75"/>beyond the office of a <hi>Mercury,</hi> to point the hand where it lies.</p>
                  <p>There is the Kings high-way to peace, and the Students private way, and both good in their kind. With the Kings way I ſhall not meddle, as being ſitter matter for our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs then inſtruction, who hath already paved the way for us by wholſom Laws for that purpoſe. But becauſe oft-times <hi>Vitia ſunt remediis fortiora,</hi> the compulſory way by Law, though always neceſſary, is not always ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; to the Kings way we muſt add the Students alſo: That every one in his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular makes it his care and buſineſs to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to it, that it be an artificial ſtudied peace, to which not Fear only, but Conſcience of Duty and Religion obligeth us.</p>
                  <p>Now every good Student of any Science ſearches into the true and proper cauſe of things; for, <hi>Scire eſt per cauſas cognoſcere.</hi> If the cauſe of all diviſion in the Church, be differing in judgement, nothing can cure that but a conſent. S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore preſcribes that for the remedy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>That there be no diviſions among you;</hi> how may that be helped? it follows, <hi>But that ye be perfectly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:32545:75"/>This is the true Apoſtolical Principle, whereon we are to ground our Study of Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et: For all the fine things and ſentences that are ſpoken for peace and quiet, will little move thoſe that are, and may very well be confident, they ought not howſoever have peace with Sin, or Error. Unleſs therefore we can be firſt perſwaded that we ought not to charge the Church with either, we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Peace, This I confeſs is the great difficulty, yet if this be not done, there can be no hope of Peace.</p>
                  <p>And to do this, I ſhall not ſend our Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Polemick School, to convince him out of <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Principles of Reaſon and Divinity; for to that ſtudy, ſome have not capacity, others not leiſure: I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend to him ſome <hi>practical</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, obvious to all, and denied by none, that out of them he may learn not to diſſent from, or condemn the Church of Error.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the paſſing that ſentence, let the Student,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Study himſelf,</hi> his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</item>
                        <item>2. Let him <hi>Study the Church</hi> againſt which he paſſeth ſentence.</item>
                        <item>3. Let him ſtudy the <hi>nature and quality</hi> of the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32545:76"/>upon judgment is given.</item>
                        <item>4. Let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well the <hi>manner of proceeding in judgment.</hi> In all which we ſhall find ſome known Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Religion to direct us.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, In the <hi>ſtudy of our ſelves,</hi> and our own condition: Religion teacheth us to have an humble, lowly, mean opinion of our ſelves; and not without cauſe whether we reſpect our Underſtandings, or our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: Our Underſtandings are naturally weak, imperfect, ſhort-ſighted, we know but in part, the beſt of us; and our Affections too are diſloyal to our Underſtandings, <hi>The heart of man,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>is deceitful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things,</hi> We have little reaſon then to truſt our ſelves much in either. He that is truly conſcious of his own weakneſs or lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will be content to be ſupported by others. If we ſtudy this point well, our own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we ſhould learn more willingly to aſſent to, and take ſupport from the Church.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially, if in the ſecond place, we ſtudy that too whoſe Governors Religion likewiſe teaches us to obey, <hi>For they watch over our ſouls,</hi> Heb. 13.17. If it be a good point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>in lowlineſs of mind to eſteem others better then our ſelves,</hi> Phil. 2.3. it is Religion and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32545:76"/>ſon both, to think our Governors wiſer too; for there is a preſumption always in favour of them. S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives it for a rule to <hi>Timothy, Not to receive an accuſation againſt an Elder,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.19.</note> 
                     <hi>but before two or three witneſſes,</hi> becauſe it is to be preſum'd on the part of Age and Authority, to know more, and offend leſs. But when it comes to be the whole Elderſhip, all our Governors joyntly, the preſumption is ſo much the ſtronger. If we add this ſtudy to the former, how little reaſon we have to truſt our ſelves, and how much we have to truſt our Governors, we will not raſhly paſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt them, if we have either Reaſon or Religion is us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And yet we have more work for our Student; Let him, in the third place; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>nature and quality</hi> of the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon judgment is given, how apt they are to deceive us. Truth is many times ſo like an Error, and Error comes ſo near to Truth, that he had need be careful and circumſpect that ſhall diſtinguiſh them in ſome caſes. And in others again, Truth lies hid under many folds, eſpecially <hi>ambiguity</hi> of words, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cheat of all Students, who are more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deceiv'd into opinions then convinc'd. It
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32545:77"/>is not ſtrange to ſee ſo many go aſtray from the Church, to whom the things of it are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under the covert of falſe names, when they hear the Government of it called Tyranny; obedience, ſlavery; contempt, courage; licence, liberty; frenzy, zeal; order, ſuperſtition. How eaſily thus may ſimple people miſtake their way, and fall into the pit that's cover'd over with ſhadows and falſe names of things? When he hath ſtudied this point well,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let him, in the fourth place; be well adviſed in what <hi>manner he proceeds in judgment,</hi> and upon what evidence: For, allowing the Conſcience to be a Judg, it muſt not treſpaſs upon the Rules of good Judicature, as, both ſides muſt be heard impartially, which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom done; the <hi>Conſcience</hi> muſt not be miſ-led no more then other Judges, by prejudice, paſſion, or favour; for what can that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be worth which is perverted by any of theſe. Now if we examine how moſt men come to paſs ſentence againſt the Church, we ſhall find it to be upon very ſlight evidence: It may be their Education, they have been always brought up that way; for Sects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly run in a blood, in a family: Or they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:32545:77"/>have been ſo taught, they ſay, by good men; that indeed is the ſum and upſhot of the Faith of moſt that diſſent, the credit given to ſome weak, private, ignorant Inſtructer, whoſe perſon they have in admiration, without any great cauſe, God knows; whereas their private judgments, becauſe they are parties, ought always to be ſuſpected, if we be wiſe; and becauſe againſt their Governors, to be contemn'd, if we be obedient.</p>
                  <p>All theſe well ſtudied, may make for peace when poſſibly Arguments, and Diſputes, and Puniſhments too will not do it. And yet if ſtill none of theſe will make our Student quiet,</p>
                  <p>Let him, in the laſt place, make trial of a common remedy that prevails in all caſes of difficulty: Let him but <hi>ſtudy his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> the ſaſeſt courſe, and he ſhall find that better provided for in the Churches judgment, then in his own; for, if he ſhould erre in following the Church, or his Governors, for that is poſſible, the greateſt part of that guilt, ſome ſay all, I ſay only the greateſt part, muſt lie at their door that command that which is unlawful: But if they ſhould erre in following their own judgment, or a Judge
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:32545:78"/>of their own chooſing, for that makes it their own too, and that is more then poſſible, all the blame and guilt then muſt of neceſſity and inexcuſably fall upon themſelves. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe principles, ſetting aſide all thoſe that may convince our judgments in particulars, from theſe alone, I ſay, we ſee how ſafe, how prudent, how religious a thing it is to ſubmit our private judgments to the publick, for the <hi>peace</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It remains only now, that we imploy our beſt endeavour and ſtudy for it, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Text, and the laſt thing to be conſidered,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ye ſtudy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>STudy is an earneſt <hi>intention of the mind,</hi> by diligent ſearch and enquiry. Wiſhing well to Quiet, or ſpeaking well of it, will not ſerve; the greateſt diſturbers of Peace will do that many times, give it a good word, when they will not part with the phanſie for it. And yet Quiet is a thing that requires care and pains ſomewhat more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For when S. <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe ſpeaks of peace, it is in the words of the ſame import, <hi>Seck peace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.11.</note> 
                     <hi>and enſue it.</hi> If it be hidden, ſeek
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32545:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>it out; if it flies from you, purſue after it. It is a buſie thing to be quiet. The word here tranſlated, <hi>Study,</hi> is in the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Be ambitious of it;</hi> that is, purſue and ſtudy it as you would do Honour and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that, I think, is as much as can be deſired; and yet no more then Quiet both deſerves and needs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It deſerves it.</hi> For though quiet be rather <hi>Status vita,</hi> then <hi>Virtus;</hi> it is no Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it ſelf, yet the beſt ſoil to plant Vertue in. <hi>The fruits of righteouſneſs are ſown in peace,</hi> Jam. 3.18. So are all the fruits of Induſtry; Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Arts, Sciences, Traffick, Commerce, flouriſh moſt in the calm temperate clime; but in troubles and diſſentions every good thing goes backward, only miſchief thrives. It fares with troubled times, as in troubled waters; all the filth, dirt and mire in the bottom gets them up to the top. We ſaw as much when our waters were lately troubled; what a deal of filth, dirt and mire, what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſtuff was then got up to the top and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place of rule and command? So much are we the more oblig'd to ſtudy that peace and quiet, which hath ſunk them to their proper place again, the bottom: And
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32545:79"/>there let them lie, if you would be quiet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it deſerves therefore our ſtudy, ſo it <hi>needs it too;</hi> for it is a difficult thing to be quiet, the way to it lies through ſo many parts and duties of Religion, and not the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them neither: To deny our ſelves, by humility and lowlineſs of mind to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our own weakneſs and frailty, to ſubmit our judgments to others, as better and wiſer then our ſelves; to ſubdue our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and luſts, from whence the Apoſtle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <hi>Wars and Contentions</hi> to come, <hi>from our Luſts;</hi> and to all theſe the Fleſh hath natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a reluctance. Our Student therefore hath need to contend with himſelf to be at peace with others.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Athens</hi> when he wrote this Epiſtle, a famous University for the ſtudy of all liberal Arts and Sciences. I cannot ſay he had theſe in his thought, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this ſtudy to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> as an Art of more uſe then any he found at <hi>Athens:</hi> Yet when I ſee him ſo paſſionately earneſt for it, to beſeech them to ſtudy, we have reaſon to value it as an Art well worthy of <hi>Schools,</hi> and Profeſſors, and Students. And they would make <hi>a Royal Society,</hi> whereof the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32545:79"/>King himſelf is Maſter, who is our Peace-maker by office, and by a care equal to that, hath by Law provided,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.2.</note> that <hi>under Him we may live a peaceable and quiet life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> He hath little ſenſe of Honour, that will not enter himſelf a Student under that conduct. The very word for <hi>Study,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, carries Honour with it.</p>
                  <p>And yet I can tell them of a higher School for it then this, and wherein Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are content to be Students. Our Lord Chriſt, the great Mediator of our eternal peace with Heaven, would not be brought into the world without a <hi>Song</hi> of Peace on Earth, by Angels:<note place="margin">S. Joh. 14.27.</note> And when he left the World, bequeathed it as a <hi>Legacy</hi> after him, <hi>My peace I leave with you.</hi> And when he comes again to judge the world, we have reaſon to look that he will call us to a reckoning how we uſe his Legacy. And ſo he will too; for he is <hi>That Lord, Matth.</hi> 24. that when he came and found ſome <hi>ſmiting their fellow-ſervants,</hi> commanding them to be <hi>cut aſunder, and have their portion with hypocrites:</hi> A puniſhment well ſitted to the offence; there was a ſchiſm in the fault, and there ſhall be another ſchiſm in the puniſhment; they who ſundred and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32545:80"/>divided from their Brethren, ſhould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs be cut aſunder, and have their portion with hypocrites. But for the Peace-makers, when he comes, he will provide better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,<note place="margin">Matt. 5.9.</note> for <hi>they ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi> Bleſſed are they then whom the Lord when he comes ſhall find at their ſtudies of that Quiet, which gives them ſo fair a Title to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt and Peace in Heaven with Chriſt, and all the Children of God.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of the former, the laſt time I had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to be called to this Service, we treated particularly; and it was a point well worthy our care and ſtudy. But the Leſſon we are now to learn, ſeems not much to deſerve or need it.</p>
                  <p>I have not (I confeſs) ſought far for a Text, but took that which came next to hand.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32545:81"/>Nor doth the Text put you to ſeek far what you are to do; It is but your own buſineſs. In both reſpects it may be thought unfit for this Audience, which is not of that quality to be entertained with no better Proviſion than what comes next to hand; and eſpecially, if that ſhould prove plain and homely, as this is, <hi>To do our own buſineſs;</hi> and as it follows, <hi>To work with our own hands:</hi> This is but a kind of <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> Doctrine; and what ſhould that do here in <hi>Court?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to leave my ſelf and the Text under this prejudice; That I ſought no farther for it, was not of eaſineſs or neglect, but Choice; Becauſe I found it not only in conjunction and company with the excellent Study of <hi>Quiet,</hi> to which any kind of <hi>retainer</hi> at large might deſerve reſpect; but alſo, Becauſe I ſaw it ſet by the Apoſtle, in a place of near and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate relation, a <hi>Principle</hi> and Foundation to it. The next way to be <hi>quiet</hi> abroad, is to be <hi>buſie</hi> at home. And though it be but plain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, 'tis never the worſe for that uſe; for <hi>Foundations</hi> are beſt, when plaineſt. It is noted as a cauſe why men make little proficiency in Arts and Sciences, that the <hi>Principles</hi> and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not ſo well ſtudied as they ſhould be.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:32545:81"/>And the reaſon why <hi>they</hi> fall under that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, is, Becauſe none of the great things which the Art it ſelf promiſes, are ſeen in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at firſt. And therefore <hi>Quintilian,</hi> that the Schollars of his Art might not be diſcouraged with the meanneſs of his Firſt Elements, tells them, that <hi>Latent Fundamenta, conſpiciuntur aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi> there is little to be ſeen in the Foundation, that lies hid under ground; all the beauty and luſter is in the Superſtruction. This doing <hi>our own buſineſs,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is a practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, whereupon depends much of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our whole lives, and ſo hath the fate of other foundations, to be little ſeen and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; It lies low under ground, and we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look it, as a thing not worthy any mans thought or care. But to give it the due, we muſt not look upon what it is in <hi>Sight,</hi> but what it is in <hi>vertue;</hi> a Principle and Foundation whereupon is built that, which is the deſire of all good men, the publick peace and quiet of the Church and Kingdom. And then we may allow it to be good Doctrine which hath ſo good a Uſe. It is a good tree that brings forth good fruit.</p>
                  <p>But then you will ſay, It muſt be in <hi>ſeaſon</hi> too. Now the wiſe man tells us,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>There is a time
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32545:82"/>for war,</hi> as well <hi>as a time for peace.</hi> And can it then be ſeaſonable again and again thus to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune the ſtudy of ſuch things as make for peace, at a time when we are all, and have cauſe to be in preparation for <hi>war?</hi> Indeed if it were ſuch a peace, as would weaken the hands of any in the purſuit of that Juſt, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and <hi>Royal Expedition,</hi> it were a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Soleciſm: But we muſt know, As there is a War that makes for Peace, ſo there is a Peace that makes for War. Unity among our ſelves, binds us cloſe together; we are the ſtronger for it. <hi>Vis unita fortior;</hi> in diviſions and diſcord, ſtrength is diſtracted and ſcattered; <hi>Dum ſinguli pugnant, omnes vincuntur.</hi> Domeſtick Peace then, though it comes not out of the <hi>Artillery,</hi> is good Ammunition for War: And it falls in well too, with the expreſs Letter and Doctrine of the Text, It is <hi>our own buſineſs.</hi> As it is the proper buſineſs of a <hi>King</hi> to protect His Subjects from the Inſolencies and Injuries of proud inſulting Neighbours; ſo it is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every good Subject too, to aſſiſt Him in it with their Lives and Fortunes. Whether therefore we ſeek for Peace at home, or have cauſe of War abroad, the duty of the Text is for us. We are doing our own buſineſs. But
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32545:82"/>though it be a good Foundation to build on every way; yet, <hi>except the Lord build the houſe, their labour is but loſt that build.</hi> Let us therefore before we go farther in the work, go to him for a bleſſing upon it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>I Take in the word <hi>(ſtudy,)</hi> being forc'd by the neceſſary conſtruction of Grammar and Reaſon. For an <hi>object</hi> without an <hi>act,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports nothing: to do our own buſineſs, may be as well a fault, as a duty; but if <hi>ſtudy</hi> be taken in, the ſenſe is certain and perfect, it is that wherein we ſhall do well to imploy our ſtudy.

                  <p>The former againſt <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> is a good leſſon,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32545:83"/>that, to awaken the lazy ſluggard out of his dead ſleep; for, they are, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his idle wanton widows,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.6.</note>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As firſt, There is a <hi>Propriety in Goods and Poſſeſsions;</hi> and againſt this, there riſes a Sect of <hi>Levellers,</hi> who tell us from the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Heavens are the Lords; but the Earth hath he given to the Children of men:</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is a Right and <hi>Propriety of Reſpect and Honour</hi> due to ſome above others. Againſt this ariſes another <hi>Sect</hi> of Levellers they call <hi>Quakers,</hi> who refuſe to <hi>give Honour to whom Honour belongs:</hi> Though this looks like a Religion againſt good manners only, or were but ſome Quarrel with the <hi>Grammarians</hi> againſt proper Names; the Miſchief of it lies deeper, and is of the ſpirit of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> who oppoſe the very Powers and Dignities themſelves, which they deſpiſe in their Titles; for they cannot be ſo fooliſh, though ſimple enough, as to make a Religion of Names only. Theſe are dangerous Sects of Levellers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32545:84"/>both; but they lie not in our way. The Text toucheth only <hi>Levellers of Buſineſs,</hi> who think they are not to be barr'd the liberty of doing any thing that is good; <hi>bonum quo communius eo melius,</hi> and ought not to be impropriate to any. But that there is a Title and Propriety in ſome to buſineſs, wherein it is not permitted to every one to interpoſe, a neceſſity in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires, The World is repleniſhed with infinite variety of things, and a great deal of work is to be done to make them uſeful and ſerviceable to us. Now it is not poſſible for every one to do all, and hardly all, in any one thing, to gain the full uſe and benefit of it. But when the works are diſtributed ſeverally to ſome, the benefit may redound to all.</p>
                  <p>All the buſineſs of the world reſers either to a <hi>Spiritual</hi> End, the good of the ſoul; or to a <hi>Temporal</hi> and Civil, our well-being while we live here upon earth: And to both theſe Ends God hath appointed and aſſigned parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons; he did not leave them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. In the Temporal there is private buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and publick. For private uſe, as in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, there is the buſineſs of the Husband and Wife, the Parent and Children, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Servants: And out of Families, for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32545:85"/>private uſe likewiſe, there is the buſineſs of Phyſicians and Advocates, Husbandmen, Merchants and Mariners, Mechanicks and Labourers; and all theſe are of private nature, though of common benefit. Then is there the publick buſineſs, by whith all theſe are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and governed,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note> and they are by S. <hi>Peter</hi> diſtinguiſhed to our hands, as that of the <hi>King as Supreme,</hi> and of <hi>Governors ſent by him;</hi> and they are Magiſtrates and Judges for Peace, Captains and Commanders for War, And beſides theſe, there is the buſineſs of Miniſters and Aſſiſtants to the Supreme Power, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, Lawyers, Officers and Servants; and all theſe are for that temporal end.</p>
                  <p>And for the Spiritual, whoſe buſineſs refers to the ſoul there is likewiſe a Propriety; as in <hi>Biſhops</hi> to <hi>Ordain,</hi> Inſtitute and Order the reſt of the Clergy ſpecially, and of the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs occaſionally, as the neceſſity of it ſhall require. Then is there the buſineſs of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in the ſeveral parts of the Dioceſs, in a more particular and immediate Cure and Charge, to be directed by, and accountable to the Biſhop. There be others <hi>Diaconal</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial to both. And all together, Temporal and Spiritual, as ſeveral Members, make one
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32545:85"/>Body; <hi>and every Member,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>hath not the ſame office,</hi> Rom. 12.4. God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his Gifts <hi>to every one ſeverally as He will,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. he did not ſcatter them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but divide them, and all hold in ſeveralty.</p>
                  <p>And as that Severance and Propriety ſtands upon good Authority; ſo <hi>Authority</hi> was, no doubt, induc't upon reaſon of Profit and Intereſt. It conduceth more to the common good, than Community it ſelf could.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, It brings <hi>Order</hi> into the common buſineſs of the world, and that takes away confuſion, which never did any thing well. <hi>To avoid fornication,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.2. <hi>let every man have his own wife.</hi> Upon the ſame Equity, to avoid the promiſcuous luſt and curioſity men have to mingle with any buſineſs, Let every man likewiſe have his own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In reaſon all buſineſs will be beſt done too, by thoſe to whom they are <hi>peculiar</hi> and proper. <hi>Artifici in ſua arte credendum.</hi> Men are moſt truſted in their own Trades. We truſt the Lawyer with our Eſtates, the Phyſician with our Bodies. I ſay nothing of our Souls; we are ſo wiſe at that work, as to truſt none but our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Yet thirdly, The <hi>nature</hi> and condition of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:32545:86"/>the buſineſs it ſelf, may require it: Some are ſo difficult, that every one cannot do, though he would; and ſome are ſo mean, that every one would not do though he could: and all are ſuch, as through the mercy of God we need not do if we will, unleſs it be our own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>We are now faln upon the <hi>Second</hi> Part, that as every one hath ſome buſineſs that is his own, ſo <hi>Duty</hi> and Religion <hi>obligeth</hi> him to take upon him <hi>no buſineſs but his own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> THis Leſſon will not be ſo eaſily learned, as the former: all confinement of it ſelf ſeems uneaſie. He that hath no mind to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, would not be tied to ſtay at home. And he that cares for no buſineſs, will take it ill to be barr'd any. But this conſinement beſides, nips the growth and encreaſe of good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they think, more would be done if every one have free liberty to do it; and therefore it is juſt and reaſonable to allow any one a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current</hi> juriſdiction with others in any thing that is otherwiſe good, though that be to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern with the <hi>King,</hi> to pray and preach, or what they pleaſe, with the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And they have as much of propriety as any can have to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:32545:86"/>buſineſs; yet even to theſe, they think any man may make a ſufficient title, that hath <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> to know what is to be done, as well as any other, and <hi>affection</hi> to do it, perhaps more then others. And all have <hi>right</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the publick, eſpecially that wherein Religion and the ſoul is concerned; how God may be beſt ſerved, and wherein His <hi>glory</hi> may be moſt promoted. Will not all theſe make a <hi>Title</hi> good enough to any buſineſs?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Glory</hi> of GOD, indeed, is a high and over-ruling Title; if we do not ſet it on our own heads, as the manner is, to make Gods glory ſerve our own. Otherwiſe that, and the reſt are ſuch things, as all men of wiſdom or conſcience ſhould have regard to, in any buſineſs they undertake; provided yet it be their own. In that every one hath liberty to improve his underſtanding and knowledg for the beſt, as well for his own ſoul as the publick good: In that let the glory of God be the <hi>Star</hi> to guide him. But all <hi>theſe</hi> do not make the buſineſs ours; they are a good qualification in any for buſineſs, yet give no <hi>right</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> to it. Great knowledg and skill in the <hi>Laws</hi> will not ſet a man upon the Bench; nor of <hi>Divinity,</hi> in the Biſhops Chair; nor will the dexterous
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:32545:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>glib-gifted tongue put a man into the Pulpit. There muſt be beſides a Title and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make them ours.</p>
                  <p>But muſt all the obligations we have to the <hi>Publick good,</hi> and to <hi>Gods honour,</hi> ſtoop to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misſions, Titles</hi> and <hi>proprieties,</hi> which are but the creatures and conſtitutions of men?</p>
                  <p>To this queſtion, I anſwer in the words of <hi>Job,</hi> 13.7. <hi>Will you ſpeak wickedly for God, and talk deceitfully for him?</hi> It is deceitful talking, to plead for God againſt himſelf; for though it ſhould be granted, that the ſorting of ſeveral employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and functions have ſomething of <hi>man</hi> in them; yet the confirmation and approbation of <hi>God</hi> makes it <hi>his,</hi> and ſo divine: for as God hath founded a divine <hi>Moral</hi> law, upon the propriety of goods and poſſeſſions, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal;</hi> yea, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet</hi> that which is anothers; and yet it comes not to be anothers, but by <hi>humane Laws:</hi> So though different ſtates of life and employments have ſomewhat in them by diſpoſition of <hi>Law,</hi> or our own choice; yet upon them is alſo founded this moral duty, to keep within thoſe bounds: For though men laid the <hi>Land-marks,</hi> yet God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>They ſhould not be removed, Deut.</hi> 19.15.</p>
                  <p>It is a kind of <hi>Burglary</hi> to break into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:32545:87"/>mans buſineſs, as well as into another mans houſe: or if you will not allow it to be theft to have anothers buſineſs found with you, as it is to have anothers goods; it is as ill as theft in S. <hi>Peter's</hi> opinion. <hi>The Murtherer, the Thief, the Evil-doer, the Buſie-body;</hi> there's a <hi>Meſſe</hi> of them, he puts them all alike together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this point, If the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>publick Good,</hi> and ſuch like fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, might let us looſe upon one anothers bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, it would quickly bring us round, where we were, to that confuſion and diſorder, for remedy whereof, the Apoſtle added this Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the former. We ſhall never learn to be quiet well, unleſs we learn alſo to keep within our own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet I deny not, but that Diſcord and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention have other cauſes beſides; for, of <hi>Pride cometh contention,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 13.10. And <hi>from covetouſneſs,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>James, they deſire, and have not, James</hi> 4.2. It is true of other Luſts, Wrath, Revenge, Envy, Slander, and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity too, break the peace too often, and had need be bound to their good behaviour all: Yet we may obſerve it, That none of all theſe do actually any great miſchief that way, till
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:32545:88"/>they firſt bring it to this, till it draws us from our own ſtation, and fling us upon ſome thing that is none of our own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> THE truth of this will more fully be ſeen in the <hi>Third</hi> Part, which comes next to be conſidered, The <hi>Operation</hi> it hath had in the world, by <hi>diſturbing</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quiet</hi> of it. <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> hath not fill'd it with more Suits and Contentions in our Goods and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, than it hath in the actions and buſineſs of our lives, What is our own, and what is not our own.</p>
                  <p>To arraign all that are guilty of breaking this Rule in ſeveral kinds, would ask a long proceſs. We will therefore take notice only here of the attempts upon <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> by thoſe whoſe buſineſs it was not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt and greateſt tempeſts and ſtorms in the Chriſtian World, have blown from that Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Wars and Combuſtions over all <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> in the time of the Emperor, <hi>HENRY</hi> the 4th, had their beginning from hence. Pope <hi>Hildebrand, GREG.</hi> vij. not content with that which his Charge and Office of Biſhop allow'd him, began to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:32545:88"/>out to himſelf a Greatneſs equal to the <hi>City</hi> he ſerv'd in, which had been <hi>Domicilium Imperii;</hi> firſt brake in upon the Temporal Power, not heard of before in the <hi>Church,</hi> though then a Thouſand years old: Where, for the better ſupport of his Greatneſs, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to get into his Diſpoſing, all Church-Promotions; and for that end, call'd a <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> of a few Biſhops for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and there <hi>Decreed</hi> all <hi>Patronages</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> by Lay-men, <hi>Princes</hi> not excepted, to be void, and of no effect in Law. What could be expected from ſo Unjuſt a Decree, but vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Oppoſition, and a bloody Diſpute? What troubles the ſame <hi>Patronage</hi> and <hi>Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi> brought preſently after into this Kingdom, our Stories are full of. But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Pope, when he ſaw he could not quietly enjoy the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Crown, falls fiercely upon the <hi>Crown</hi> it ſelf, and would be Maſter of that too; and then he thought he ſhould Rule to purpoſe for the Catholick Cauſe. And for an Eſſay of this bold Uſurp'd Power, fairly <hi>Depoſed</hi> the Emperor, and <hi>abſolv'd</hi> his Subjects of their Obedience. This was certainly no Biſhops buſineſs. He may bleſs the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not diſpoſe of the Crown. He may pray
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:32545:89"/>for a Godly and Peaceable Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, not make a prey of it. To abſolve Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents of their Sins, is a Biſhops work; not of their Duties; that is not to remit their Sins, but to make them Sinners. Now what was likely to be the effect of all this, but that which hapned, <hi>Wars</hi> and Combuſtions over the whole <hi>Empire?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though that Pope did not long out-live that <hi>Feite</hi> of his, yet his Succeſſors and their Paraſites have ſo ply'd the Cauſe ever ſince that time, ſome directly, ſome indirectly, that the fire is not yet extinguiſhed. Now if the Pope met with ſome <hi>Princes</hi> that would not endure his <hi>Ranging</hi> thus in their Dominions, but thought it high time to quit his Miter, to ſecure their Crowns, he may thank himſelf for it. They may call it a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> if they pleaſe; but it is a Schiſm without a Sin. That word will hurt none ſo much as the Cauſers and Authors of it; For it is but reaſonable and juſt, That if the <hi>Pope</hi> would not know his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that <hi>Princes</hi> ſhould know theirs. This is my <hi>Firſt</hi> Inſtance, of the Troubles that by this means brake into the whole Church.</p>

And again, He may ſerve and worſhip God with as much fervency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion as he can and will; he may abound in Charity, Meekneſs, Humility, Patience and Temperance, and all other Chriſtian vertues: And <hi>ſo long as ye thus follow that which is good,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter, who will harm you?</hi> And I may ſay too,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.13.</note> who can hinder you in all this? but if he makes himſelf a party in a <hi>Sect,</hi> if there be aſſembling together in companies, gather Congregations, incorporate in a Body, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule Churches, give Laws of Doctrine and Worſhip, ſet up Teachers and Leaders of their own; to all this they have as little Right, as they have need. A man may go far, ye ſee, in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32545:91"/>Religion, without troubling any; and if then they fall into ſome Error or Misbelief in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they ought not to be ſeverely handled; but when they betake themſelves to a <hi>Sect,</hi> that alters the caſe, it will then be compaſſion mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. A <hi>Locuſt</hi> alone is no ſuch perilous beaſt to be fear'd or regarded by any; but when they come in ſhoals and ſwarms, and cover the face of the earth, they are a plague to the Countrey where they light. So to look upon a <hi>Sectary</hi> ſingle, who out of ſimplicity and good meaning follows his Conſcience, our hearts ſhould be every whit as tender for them, as their Conſciences are. But if we look upon them in <hi>Company,</hi> they are as ill and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as the company they are found in; and the danger of all popular Meetings, and Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations to a State, makes it the proper buſineſs of a King and his Miniſters to look to it, and to provide againſt it; wherein the care hath been taken, deſerves a juſt commendation.</p>
                  <p>And yet when I aſſert and refer this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the KING, I look to be call'd to an account for that; For they take the boldneſs by way of recrimination, to turn the Text upon, the King himſelf, <hi>That His Power is Civil, and Matters of the Church and Religion
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32545:91"/>are Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and ſo none of his buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>This is, I confeſs, too weighty a matter to be here thruſt into the corner of a Sermon; yet it will be neceſſary to ſay ſo much as may ſomewhat lay that loud clamour againſt it: For the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> both, how ill ſoever they may agree in other matters, hunt in couples againſt the Kings Power and <hi>SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREMACY.</hi> But as we denie not all to others in their places; ſo we claim not all for the King. If I ſhall but only now ſet out <hi>His</hi> Part in matters of the Church, it will appear ſufficiently, that he is <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> ſtands right in the Text, and takes not upon him buſineſs which is not his own.</p>
                  <p>We acknowledge the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> to be two diſtinct Powers; and though they may be both in one Perſon, and were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſo; yet by the Divine, <hi>poſitive</hi> Laws both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they were ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, that though one perſon were capable of both, yet not without a lawful <hi>Title</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture to either. I cannot therefore think, That the King is an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon, who was never Ordained or Conſecrated to be ſo. Therefore when ſome Learned in our Laws affirm, That the <hi>KING</hi> is Supreme Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:32545:92"/>and <hi>mixta perſona,</hi> it muſt be underſtood in ſome other ſenſe, and for ſome other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for we do not find that he attempts the doing any thing that is the proper act of an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Yes, they ſay, he claims by his Title of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> To govern <hi>all perſons in all cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We acknowledg this to be his juſt Title; but deny, that he doth any thing by it, which is not properly his <hi>own</hi> buſineſs, and in <hi>Right</hi> of his Crown. That he is the Fountain alſo of all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, though it be not expreſly in his Title, we acknowledge to be in his Power. But here I muſt crave leave to ſay ſomething of the nature and notion of JURISDICTION, though it ſhall taſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the race and harſhneſs of the School; yet much of the <hi>Caſe</hi> depends upon it, and no little miſtakes there are about it.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed generally, That there is in the Church a Power of <hi>Orders,</hi> and a Power of <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> diſtinct; that is, for the <hi>Power,</hi> though not diſtinct in the <hi>object</hi> and matter of that power; for that is the ſame in both: As, preaching Gods Word, adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or the Cenſures of the Church, are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:32545:92"/>of the power of <hi>Orders.</hi> And the putting all, or any of theſe in execution, is by a power of <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> The former, as Divines diſtinguiſh, is a power in <hi>habitu,</hi> the other in <hi>actu.</hi> So that <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> is nothing elſe, <hi>but a power to do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, what was potentially or habitually receiv'd in Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not here take <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> in the ſtrict vulgar ſenſe, to be a power <hi>jus dicendi inter partes litigantes</hi> only, as the word imports; but more largely, as it reacheth to any act of Order, without which it cannot lawfully be put in execution.</p>
                  <p>Now the Queſtion here will be, <hi>How a King can be the Fountain of the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction us'd in his Dominions, who neither givs Orders himſelf, not executes any; that is, hath neither power of Orders, nor Power of Juriſdiction?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Anſwer to this Queſtion, is, That the Kings Power lies without both theſe, and is that which gives Commiſſion and Faculty to perſons ordained to execute their Orders within his Dominions. And the Reaſon, Ground and Neceſſity of that is, Becauſe the Eccleſiaſtical Function cannot be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but by ſuch ways and means as are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and originally in the King, and in <hi>Right of</hi> his Crown.

Hath he done all that belongs to his proper place and Function, which is certainly his own? Or hath he a Family at home to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, that no doubt is his too?

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32545:98"/>think we ſee not all things ſo well carried in the Church and Government, as we could wiſh; yet having gone as far to mend it, as the <hi>line</hi> of our own buſineſs will reach, and the fartheſt end of that is, having peaceably mov'd for it, and heartily pray'd for it, we may with a ſafe and quiet Conſcience, leave the reſt to God, and thoſe to whom he hath committed that Care and Charge, whoſe <hi>proper</hi> buſineſs it is. And <hi>as many as walk according to this Rule, Peace be on them,</hi> and Mercy from the God of Peace and Mercy; To whom be all honour, glory and praiſe, for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we look into the particulars of the Doctrine of this Text, we may from the Preface <hi>[Be not deceived]</hi> learn ſo much of the nature of it, that we are either in danger to be deceived, or in great danger if we ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32545:100"/>be deceived, or both. It will therefore be neceſſary, firſt to implore the aid and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods grace, which is the beſt Guide to lead us through the intricate ways of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Deceit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Text it ſelf ſeems not at firſt ſight to anſwer the expectation which the Preface hath raiſed of Danger to us. It hath but one purpoſe, but that is carried upon two Propoſitions; One General, That <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man ſows, he ſhall reap.</hi> The other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, of what ſhall be reaped, from the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or from the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the General, I muſt confeſs, it is a truth wherein few or none are deceived, not any Gardener or Plough-man, never ſo ſimple, that looks to reap what he hath not ſown. God gave that vertue in the Creation to all living things <hi>to bring forth after their kind.</hi> And our Saviour himſelf made uſe of it to a higher purpoſe, <hi>we cannot gather Grapes of Thorns, nor Figgs of Thiſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So far we may poſſibly digeſt this truth in the General, and fear not much to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> but when we come to Particulars, where it touches our own <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> though it be as true as the General, and muſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32545:100"/>be ſo, being contained in it: yet becauſe in this caſe it mixeth with our own Intereſt and Affection, what we wiſh may not be true, we are eaſily miſled to think it ſo.</p>
                  <p>To this therefore, at leaſt the Caution in the Preface is proper and neceſſary, though not in the General. For this reaſon I ſhall lay that aſide, as leſs liable to fraud, and beſtow our care at this time upon this to which the Apoſtle directs his, where we are in danger to be deceived; <hi>He that ſoweth to the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And here our firſt care muſt be that we be not <hi>deceived</hi> in the meaning of the words; which look ſo like a Deſcription of the Day of Judgment, that ſome Expoſitors have taken them for it, and to be the ſame with that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We ſhall all appear before the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that every man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not refuſe this Expoſition for any danger that might come by miſtaking, for it would howſoever lead us to a point of great conſequence, and not a little neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for theſe times in which our beloved <hi>Liberty</hi> hath rifled ſo far into the Myſteries
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32545:101"/>of <hi>Religion,</hi> and digged ſo much about the Foundation, that the Houſe is in danger; where, they ſay, all depends upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of others, who know as little as our ſelves whether there be a Heaven or Hell, or Day of Judgment or no. The detection of ſo dangerous a Deceit had been neceſſary, if the occaſion had been as fit; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave it to other Texts, which are more proper for it then this is, knowing well, that Truth receives not more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice any way, then when it is ſet upon weak and uncertain Foundations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now the reaſon why I take not that ſenſe in here, is becauſe the words will not fairly bear it. If it had been ſowing the ſins and luſts of the fleſh, whereupon the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be given, it had been clear for that; but the words are <hi>to the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>to the Spirit,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and ſo muſt have another meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as the <hi>Sowing,</hi> ſo the <hi>Reaping</hi> alſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from that at the Day of Judgment; for he that <hi>ſowes to the fleſh ſhall reap corruption;</hi> and it will be hard to find <hi>Everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> in that word, which naturally ſignifies no more then privation of Life or Being. Now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32545:101"/>they that give themſelves over all their lives to the luſts of the fleſh without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, would be content with this doom, and hear no quit all ſcores with Dying, if they might more of it.</p>
                  <p>What other ſenſe then will the words more properly bear? <hi>To the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>to the ſpirit,</hi> imply rather the <hi>ſoil</hi> wherein they are to <hi>ſowe,</hi> then the <hi>ſeed,</hi> and are as two <hi>Fields</hi> in which God ſets all men to work. Every one hath two Ploughs going, one to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and another to the <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the <hi>Fleſh</hi> firſt, it muſt be taken ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly from the <hi>ſins</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> though it be hard parting them, as the beſt of us know; yet we may conſider them apart, and ſo we ſaw them in our Saviour, who took our fleſh upon him, that is, our natural and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil condition of life, he had all the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the one except ſin, and the burthens of the other; he was born under the Law, and paid obedience and tribute to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power. This is that fleſh which God hath given us as a ſtock to be imployed, but upon account. He hath not given us our natural lives to fling away at our pleaſures, by diſorders, diſtempers, or quarrels. Nor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32545:102"/>hath he put us here into the World into the ſocieties of men, to live in want and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but to improve our induſtry to the beſt advantage both to our ſelves and others; and may by that attain to ſome luſter and ſplendor of riches, honour, and command, to which no oppreſſion, or extortion, or any lucky ſin hath advanced us, and that is, though we have brought no corruption into the fleſh, yet we ſhall reap corruption from it. This is a Doctrine, which our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience abundantly confirms, by the frequent turnings, changes and viciſſitude of things.</p>
                  <p>But that our deſires ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably fixed upon things ſo mutable, muſt be ſome great deluſion, or in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles phraſe in a like manifeſt caſe, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching, not to truſt our own eyes in what we ſee every day. But becauſe though the World be full of Deceivers, we are ſtill the greateſt deceivers of our ſelves; let us take it upon the credit of others, and thoſe the wiſeſt Kings, <hi>Solomon,</hi> and his Father <hi>David,</hi> who may be the better truſted in this, for that neither of them were any great enemies to the fleſh. <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32545:102"/>run through all the glories, pleaſures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the world, never any King drank deeper in that cup; yet he at laſt wearied, ſate down to write a Book to teach others, that all was <hi>Vanity,</hi> and that is but another word to ſignifie <hi>Corruption.</hi> And <hi>David,</hi> as well of obſervation as experience, <hi>I my ſelf have ſeen the ungodly in great power flouriſhing like a green Bay tree; I went by and lo he was gone, I ſought him, and his place could no where be found, Pſal.</hi> 37.36. And leaſt we ſhould think this the portion onely of the ungodly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.9. <hi>Wiſe men alſo die and periſh together, as well as the ignorant and fooliſh, and leave their riches for others:</hi> and it may be not that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>For riches</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe man <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.) <hi>make themſelves wings and fly away from the owner.</hi> And at another time the Owner too makes himſelf wings and flies away from them. All things in the World are upon the Wing. And it is a ſtrange deceit the Prophet obſerves (<hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) <hi>And yet they think that their houſes ſhall continue for ever.</hi> And to give themſelves a kind of Immortality, <hi>they call them after their own names.</hi> But they are oft times deceived in that too; ſo far doth Corruption eat into all our deſigns. The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32545:103"/>lewd people will be the Goſſips and name the Child in deſpite of the Father; and that little to his liking or honour. We are not ſure to enjoy that poor vanity to leave a name behind us upon that which coſt us ſo much care and expenſe. Laſtly, How well ſoever he ſpeeds here, and that <hi>the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his houſe be increaſed,</hi> yet this will be certain, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 17.) <hi>He ſhall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, neither ſhall his pomp fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not think by this, or any thing that can be ſaid more, to make you our of love with the <hi>fleſh,</hi> it is neither poſſible nor need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I ſhall only for a concluſion of this firſt part beg in the Apoſtles name, that ye would not be deceived, as all are who give more for a thing then it is worth. To ſpend all our time and coſt upon that which will be worth nothing; or as ill, no better then rottenneſs and corruption.</p>
                  <p>I make the more haſte through this Field of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that we may ſtay the longer in that of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> where our labour and til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage will be to better purpoſe, for ye ſee the beſt that can be hoped for from the other, is but to flouriſh as a Flower of that Field,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32545:103"/>and that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.19. <hi>as ſoon as the wind goeth over it is gone. Nullus flos niſi novus.</hi> Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption bloweth upon the moſt florid condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it. But the growth and increaſe from the field of the Spirit is incorruptible, that <hi>fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>for he that ſoweth, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we ſee ſo great a Harveſt, and yet ſo few Labourers in the Field, ſome ſtrange deluſion there muſt be, whereſoever it lies; we muſt confeſs the Apoſtles caution here was no more then needs: <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</hi> For is it poſſible where ſo good wages are, ſo few ſhould ſet themſelves at work? unleſs they either miſtruſted their pay, Eternal Life, and ſo mocked God that promiſed it; or miſtook the ſowing, and ſo deceived themſelves. Both theſe would deſerve to be well conſidered, but becauſe they who have ſome diffidence of a life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to come, have not the confidence to ſay ſo; I have not ſo much ſpare time as to ſpend in proving that which they will be ready to ſay they do not deny. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now endeavor only to undeceive them, if it may be, in the vain pretences they make to it in the <hi>ſowing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:32545:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>And here, firſt it will be neceſſary, that whatever elſe deceives them, to ſee, that a miſunderſtanding of the words give no occaſion to it, to know what this <hi>ſowing to the Spirit</hi> is, and how it comes to make a Title to Everlaſting Life, for there are no mean Competitors in the ſame Claim.

                  <p>Is there yet another way to Everlaſting life by <hi>ſowing to the Spirit?</hi> It is happy for us that there is any way to it, but yet we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32545:104"/>may be at a loſs and confounded where there are ſo many.</p>
                  <p>To remove that fear, we muſt know, that all theſe are but ſeveral name of the ſame thing, though in divers appearances, and <hi>Phaſes,</hi> as the Aſtronomers word is, <hi>Chriſt, the Goſpel, Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> do all relate to <hi>life everlaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the Author of it, provided all things neceſſary to it. The <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of all that is to be known or done to attain it. <hi>Faith</hi> is our ſubmiſſion and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher and preacher of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſt which in other ages was not made known to the ſons of men, as it is now revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apoſtles and Prophets by the Spirit.</hi> And for this reaſon the Apoſtle expreſly calls the <hi>Goſpel</hi> the <hi>Spirit, Gal.</hi> 3.3. For whereas they having already embraced the Goſpel, fell back to Circumciſion and other rites of the Law, ſeverely charges them with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> folly; <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh having begun in the ſpirit, are ye now made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> they are ſo called <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Carnal Ordinances;</hi> and the reaſon why is intimated, becauſe they were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32545:105"/>temporal, impoſed upon them, until the time of Reformation and no longer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Goſpel <hi>abideth for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee that Chriſt, and Faith, and the Goſpel, and the Spirit muſt all meet in the title to everlaſting life; if we ſeparate and divide them, we are certainly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; it is a fallacy <hi>à compoſitis ad diviſa,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding thoſe things which the Spirit hath joyned together. And by this we may trie and examine the ſufficiency of their Pleas apart and divided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, For thoſe that make their title to life from Chriſt alone, that they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at large, not to be tied up by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rules of Faith or Obedience, that is to divide Chriſt from his Goſpel againſt his own will, who promiſed to reward them that forſook any thing for his ſake and the Goſpel, he joins them both together, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.29. and will not own them for his friends that do not all that he commands them, <hi>John</hi> 15. and they ſhall find more Work-commandments in the Goſpel then a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical name of Chriſtianity. Whileſt by this means they think to avoid Schiſm, they make one, for they are Schiſmaticks upon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32545:105"/>record, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. It is declared (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) that there are diviſions, the Greek word is Schiſms among you; every one of you ſaith I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> I am of <hi>Apollos,</hi> I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> I am of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Is that a Schiſm to be for Chriſt? Yes ſure, it is dividing of him; for he adds, <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> and how could that be, but from his Apoſtles, whom he had appointed to inſtruct them in the Goſpel, and had made them as it were one perſon with himſelf, <hi>He that hears you hears me.</hi> And thus was Chriſt divided.</p>
                  <p>What could probably be the cauſe of this ſeparation from them, but that they were not ſatisfied either with their Doctrine, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeverity of their Diſcipline, ſought to ſhroud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelves under the name of Chriſt, not out of a great reſpect to him and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which we may well preſume could not differ, but becauſe it was a more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way to ſhift off their Authority, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing from the Servants to the Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Much after this Copy do our Chriſtians of the <hi>Latitude</hi> write. They believe in Chriſt without a Creed, they obey him without doing his Will; they worſhip him, no man knows how, but every man as he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32545:106"/>likes; and if he likes that better, not at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As theſe are deceived by dividing Chriſt from his Goſpel, ſo ſecondly others by the ſame fallacie divide the Spirit from it. So fully was the Myſtery of Chriſt made known in the Goſpel by the Spirit, that St. <hi>John</hi> gives a charge, that if there come any that bring not that Doctrine, <hi>not to receive him, nor bid him God ſpeed,</hi> 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. This Doctrine ſerves not many mens purpoſe, they muſt have other Doctrines, and to credit them, other Spirits too. Every one will have a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Spirit of his own to teach him.</p>
                  <p>But are we to look for no other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Spirit, but what is already taught in the Goſpel? that is to depoſe him of his Office from the time that the Goſpel was firſt revealed, and leave him no work to do after. God forbid, there are many other excellent Offices of the Spirit beſides Revelation; there is the Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof we have continual need, to infuſe all divine Graces and Vertues into us, to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen us in all our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to lead us out of temptations, troubles, and dangers, which every day ſurround us; yet not to reveal anew what we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32545:106"/>or do, which is already done in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. And yet the Spirit will help us in that too; For when any difficulty or contention ariſe about them, we may and muſt pray for the Spirits aſſiſtance, to clear our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, by removing pride and prejudice that obſcure it; to inflame us with a true love of truth, not to dictate and reveal, or whiſper any thing which is not to be ſeen in the Goſpel, as well by the eyes of others as our own.</p>
                  <p>But doth not the <hi>Spirit bear witneſs to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that we are the children of God?</hi> This can be no other but a private Spirit. That this Text ſtand not in our way (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.) we muſt diſtinguiſh, not onely, as I have ſaid already, the Spirit by the ſeveral operations of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſanctifying: So of the ſeveral kinds of bearing witneſs, which is either proper, by affirming or denying any thing expreſly, or improperly, by proof and argument from the Nature and Incidents of the matter in queſtion; as <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>God left not himſelf without witneſs in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons.</hi> Rain and fruitful ſeaſons affirm nothing of God, yet prove ſufficiently his Godhead, Power,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32545:107"/>and Providence in governing the World.</p>
                  <p>Now the Spirit in both theſe ſenſes doth <hi>bear witneſs to our ſpirits, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> without the help of private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations. For if we ſpeak of bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs properly, the publick Spirit in the Goſpel will effect that where it gives this teſtimony, That whoſoever believes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and amends his life, is the Child of God, when our ſpirits can experimentally aſſume that we are ſo qualified, then the Spirit in the Goſpel <hi>beareth witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the children of God.</hi> And if we ſpeak of bearing witneſs in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, of proving by argument and reaſon, then the Spirit of Sanctification working a real change in us, a deteſtation of Sin, and a true love and practice of Vertue and Godlineſs, beareth witneſs to our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that we are the children of God. Here is therefore no place in this Text for private Revelations, and I wiſh they had none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; for under colour of them, every one will have a private Spirit, though of his own making. No Chymiſt can extract Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits out of any thing with more eaſe, then they can Divine; any vain Dream or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32545:107"/>Imagination, nay any wicked deviliſh ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion ſhall be an impulſe of Gods Spirit. It were happy for this Kingdom and Church if we could lay theſe Familiar Spirits; No <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Church, no <hi>Miſchief</hi> in the Commonwealth; no <hi>Rebellious Practice</hi> which was not carried on by the conduct and impulſe of theſe Spirits. Thus by them they trouble the World, deceive ſimple men, and work deſpite to the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> There is yet another title made to <hi>Life-everlaſting</hi> upon the ſame fallacie, by <hi>Faith</hi> divided from the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> hath been an unhappy word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but I ſhall onely take notice here of the inſufficiency of the Plea of that Faith, which by thoſe that invented it, is called, <hi>Fides ſpecialis miſericordiae,</hi> that no man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and by conſequence, hath right to <hi>Life Everlaſting,</hi> but he that believes by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mercy to him in particular, his ſins are forgiven; or which is all one, that he is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for without that there is no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>The Faith of the Goſpel they think is too general, without life, and common to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32545:108"/>Devils, who <hi>believe and tremble;</hi> they are <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> too, and yet are <hi>Devils.</hi> I cannot ſay how much of the Goſpel they believe, but by their trembling, and their own confeſſion to our Saviour, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> that they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Article of the laſt Judgment; that they ſhall be one day tormented for their ſins. By the way, the Devils may ſhame them that have not learned ſo far in their Creed.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this, we muſt not be ſo kind to the Devils, as to think they have the Faith of the Goſpel, becauſe that works by love; <hi>Circumciſion availeth not any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith that worketh by love, Gal.</hi> 5.6. I think no man hath ſo much charity for the Devils, as to think they have any. There is no reaſon therefore why the Faith of the Goſpel ſhould ſuffer for their ſakes. The word of Faith, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>is that which we preach,</hi> and that was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Our particular election may be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of Life in Heaven, but it is no where to be found written in the Book of the Goſpel. True Faith is that which we preach, ſaith the Apoſtle, but this Faith of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32545:108"/>Election no man can preach; for who can ſay and ſay truly of his own knowledge, that I, or you, or any man by name is elected. Now if this Faith cannot come by hearing, what will become of our Sermons? indeed, of any thing that can be called <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Sowing to the Spirit?</hi> for that leads us a way to Heaven through believing ſome myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we underſtand not, through many a heavy and hard law of mortification and denying our ſelves; whereas this Faith cuts off all that, and may well go for <hi>ſowing to the fleſh.</hi> For firſt, in favour to this, it ſhrinks up all the duties of the Goſpel into Faith; and then all Faith into one Article, and that not in the Creed neither: and ſomething they pare from that too, it works not as an act which we may call ours, for that will prejudice Gods free Grace, but as a relation to Chriſt; and in the Logick Schools it is diſputed, whether Relations have any real being or no. And thus all hangs upon a Pins point, and leaves not a Corn to be <hi>ſown to the Spirit.</hi> We may therefore conclude that this, and the other Pretenders are all deceived, miſtake the Field of the Spirit, which is the Goſpel, and ſowe quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide it.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:32545:109"/>
                  <p>It will be now time to enter into the Field it ſelf, and ſee what work the Spirit there ſets us to. It is a large Field, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as far as the Goſpel; indeed too large to be paſſed through at one time. But this as a great Country may be ſeen in a little Chart.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. A fourth is a careful uſe of the auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Grace, Sacraments, Faſtings, and other acts of Humiliation.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Fifthly, Then we have the adorning all theſe with comely and decent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. This laſt though far from the Heart of Religion, is yet within the Body of it, as well as the reſt.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I have not yet named, which ſeems at a farther diſtance from the great duties of the Goſpel, and yet hath the advantage above the reſt, that it is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32545:109"/>called, <hi>ſowing to the Spirit;</hi> and what that is, we ſhall learn from the Verſe prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; where</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. The Apoſtle exhorts <hi>him that is taught in the Word, to communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</hi> If there be any coherence in the diſcourſe, any reaſon in the rational Particle <hi>[for] For he that ſoweth unto the Spirit.</hi> The communicating our Goods for the Goſpel, is <hi>true ſowing to the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This duty therefore together with thoſe already named, are all Sowing to the Spirit, and have a joint tendency to life everlaſting. For the meaning is not that any of them apart make a full Title to it, but according to their quality and degree carry us their part in the way towards it.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore but a piece of fraud and Sophiſtry to diſcountenance one duty, by ſetting up a greater againſt it, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, that the main purpoſe of the Goſpel looks another way. And ſo run down one duty with another, the leſs with the greater, as Great Perſons do their Inferiors. This is not onely a Deceit, but plain mocking of God, who commands both, and a ſetting him againſt himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:32545:110"/>
                  <p>I note this Fallacy in common, that it be not made uſe of here on our particular, to miſlead us from the due regard ought to be given to the maintenance of thoſe that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the Goſpel; though it be not the accompliſhment of the great duties, yet hath a remote influence upon all. Set it in as low a place in Gods Houſe as you pleaſe, but for the Spirits ſake, let it not be turned out of dores.</p>
                  <p>I ſingle out this duty from the reſt, that may deſerve our care more, and need it leſs. It hath fewer friends to ſpeak for it I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, but the true reaſon why I do it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the particular occaſion of the Apoſtles delivering this doctrine; and in this I ſhall keep both a better meaſure with the Time, and with the Apoſtles intention, and it is a point too, wherein we are as much <hi>deceived</hi> as in any.</p>
                  <p>Our worldly Goods by nature and kind are Carnal, yet being <hi>ſown to the Spirit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſpiritual, they are infranchiſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate into the Family and Retinue of the Spirit, they alter their property, not by imprinting any real indelible character into them, as envy and ill-will objects, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32545:110"/>onely the reſpect that perſons of low birth have, when they are adopted or affian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a more noble Stock. When the <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſerves the <hi>Spirit</hi> it is advanced above her condition, the Volatile nature of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> is fixed by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and helps to make up the title to everlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>This is warrant enough for me to make a Suit, and reward enough for thoſe that grant it: That for Gods ſake and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when the Church Revenue comes into your thoughts to caſt an eye, if not of duty, of compaſſion upon ſuch miſerable places, where there is but too much neceſſity for it. I can ſpeak of my own knowledge, that there are many hundreds of Pariſhes in this Kingdom, where there is not ſo much year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintenance for ſerving the Cure, as one of your Foot-men ſtand you in.</p>
                  <p>If ſo great a ſcandal to Religion, and real obſtruction to it, be in theſe indigent Times too heavy a burthen to be removed, and therefore unſeaſonable alſo to be moved. Though this be no time of <hi>ſowing to the Spirit,</hi> it can be no ſeaſon to pull up that which hath been already ſown by the devotion of others.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:32545:111"/>
                  <p>'Tis ſtrange that the Church mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould be thought to hang ſo looſe, more then other mens Eſtates, as that any man, when the ſullen humour takes him, can think to blow them away with a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Let the Church Lands be ſold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they were held onely upon <hi>Frank al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign,</hi> it is as firm a Tenure as any is in Law. But it is more ſtrange, that they ſhould think to mock and elude God, who once declared it to be a robbing of him alſo. When he charged the Jews for detaining Tithes and Offerings from the Prieſts of that Altar. What reaſon can be given that the Miniſters of a better Covenant ſhould have a worſe title? There are not many Eſtates in the World beſides which God himſelf owns; this bears the Image and Superſcription of the Spirit. It muſt be a deſperate boldneſs to break into his peculiar, to ſtir any thing that is ſown in his Field.</p>
                  <p>And that it may not ſeem ſtrange that Carnal things ſhould be thus advanced to ſpirituals; for by a like converſion Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things degenerate into Carnal. This likewiſe will be worth our obſervation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Religion</hi> is out of doubt a Spiritual thing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32545:111"/>yet if that ſpread and run into Schiſms, it grows Carnal. For while one ſaith, <hi>I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>They who cauſe diviſions among you ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Bellies;</hi> if any thing be fleſh ſure the Belly is.</p>
                  <p>If there be ſo much malignance and ſowreneſs in Schiſms and Diviſions to turn Religion into Fleſh, what ſhall we think of a Religion, in Deſign, that is made up all of Sects and Diviſions? that muſt be all Fleſh. I ſay no more, it is in private Deſign onely; as when St. <hi>Paul</hi> charged the <hi>Corinths</hi> with ſtrife, and ſchiſm, it was but upon report onely. <hi>It is reported</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by them of the houſe of Cloe, that there are contentions among you.</hi> So I ſay, <hi>onely,</hi> it is reported from a houſe of <hi>Cloe,</hi> how theſe Schiſms ſhall be diſpoſed of. A Church ſhall be contrived that will give room and Liberty to them all.</p>
                  <p>But if the Church muſt be new modelled for their ſakes, they muſt new model the Rules of Wiſdom and Government too; For by that it was ever thought neceſſary that the People ſhould conform to the Laws of the Church; never that a Church ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32545:112"/>conform to the humours of the People.</p>
                  <p>This is ſo irregular a thing, that it will not be labour loſt to take a little farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. And firſt that you may know it by name, it is to be called, <hi>a Comprehenſive Church;</hi> a name, I muſt confeſs, not unfit for the purpoſe, though I think it might have been better called a Drag-net, that will fetch in all kind of Fiſh, good or bad, great or ſmall, there will be room enough for <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan to take his paſtime therein.</hi> But how ſhall the Church be drawn out to ſuch a bredth and latitude?</p>
                  <p>That will be no hard matter to do. It is but pulling down the Old Walls, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Doctrine, and Canons of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Lay all common, and then no doubt there will be room enough for all.</p>
                  <p>But will theſe prove ſo good company when they are in, for whoſe ſake this ſhould be done? Will they not rather give us cauſe to fear what the poor <hi>Trojans</hi> found, when they broke down the old Walls of their City to let in a Horſe with a <hi>Comprehenſive Belly,</hi> that carried armed enemies enough to ruine them and their City.</p>
                  <p>And leaſt we ſhould think this done for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32545:112"/>love of their company, they let us know they have no meaner inducement to it, then that which governs all the World, Gain and Profit, advancement of Trade, and increaſe of Money. This is plain dealing, they profeſs to ſowe the Spirit to the Fleſh. They will make a Church that ſhall make us rich. But can there be any blame or harm in this? Can we not be Religious and rich too? I will not diſpute that, if we bring riches up to Religion. But I will diſpute it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it too, if we bring Religion down to Riches. Godlineſs may be Gain, but Gain will never be Godlineſs. Riches may be a good Nurſe to cheriſh it, but an ill Mother to bring it forth, for <hi>whatſoever is born of the fleſh is fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the greateſt diſhonour that can be to the Spirit to make it ſerve for Compoſt, onely to lay in the Field of the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>But theſe, you ſay, though carnal things, may be ſecondary ends, which do not make void the ſpiritual. <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are the two Pillars whereon this Church is to be built, and they will ſerve to keep up the Spirit in it.</p>
                  <p>We cannot deny but that they are true
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32545:113"/>ſpiritual things, but if both theſe Pillars ſhould fail, there would nothing be left in the Church but Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For Peace and Union, that which feeds the hope of that, is taking down the Walls that divide them; that is, removing the Confeſſions and Canons, and all will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fall in together.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to this, we muſt diſtinguiſh the quality of the perſons for whom this room is to be made. And they are either ſuch as will be content to leave their faults and errours behind them; and to thoſe we ſhall do well to ſet our gates wide open, and need not pull down our Walls. Or they are ſuch as bring their errours, animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and divided judgments along with them. And to pacifie theſe, the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Walls will do no good, for they bring their Diviſions with them into the Bowels of the Church, where the flame will be more fierce and dangerous, then when it burnt onely without. All the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit can be hoped for by taking away the Confeſſions and Canons, is but to ſecure them from puniſhment, but leaves them free to all other cauſes of diſſention, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32545:113"/>fortifies and animates them to purſue their differences with more violence. Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Authority will not cool their zeal of advancing the Intereſt of their Sect; for it is not <hi>Toleration</hi> but <hi>Maſtery</hi> they aim at. In the mean time our <hi>Sowing</hi> will be turned into <hi>Fighting,</hi> our <hi>Plough-ſhares</hi> into <hi>Swords;</hi> the <hi>field of the Spirit</hi> into a <hi>field of War,</hi> and thus we ſhall live in a perpetual ſtorm. This is all the hope we have of Peace by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And for <hi>Charity,</hi> we ſhall find it hath as little to do here. It will be neither want of Charity to leave them out, nor a work of Charity to take them in.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will be no want of Charity to leave them out, if by that we condemn them not. And condemn them we do not, if we keep St. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule. Schiſmaticks are without the Church, we judge not them; <hi>Thoſe that are without the Church, God judgeth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. They muſt ſtand or fall to God. And when we do refuſe them, we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them to Hell. All we ſay is, if they will not go to Heaven our way, they ſhall not go in our company; and in truth they cannot.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:32545:114"/>
                  <p n="2">2. It is no work of Charity to take them in with all their faults. For though Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be a good natured Vertue, and covers a multitude of ſins, but when they are not known abroad, but cheriſheth none that are. I could never think it a breach of Charity to condemn Hereſie or Schiſm, which are known ſins, though it be againſt Charity to condemn any perſon of either, of whoſe guilt there may be doubt. Charity may ſometimes abſolve the Offender, but never the Offence. When the Offence is known to us, and the Fact avowed by them, they cannot be taken in for Charity ſake, if we love our own quiet, and Charity begins at home.</p>
                  <p>Now if neither Peace nor Charity have any ſhare in framing this <hi>New Church,</hi> I may for a Concluſion ask the queſtion our Saviour did the Jews concerning <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, <hi>Is it from Heaven, or of men?</hi> or which is all one, is it from the <hi>Fleſh</hi> or from the <hi>Spirit?</hi> If they ſhall ſay from the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> all men will adjudge it to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; If they ſhall ſay from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or from the Spirit, I will ask them another queſtion, Whether a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32545:114"/>Walls can be of Gods making? <hi>His Church is a garden encloſed, Cant.</hi> 4.12. And when he planted a Vineyard, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5.2. and that was his Church, <hi>he fenced it in.</hi> But when he ſaw it brought forth wild Grapes, then he threatens them with this Judgment, <hi>I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up; and break down the Wall thereof, and it ſhall be trodden down.</hi> Can it be wiſdom to draw that upon our ſelves, which God would not inflict but in vengeance? To make the Field of the Spirit no better then the Field of the Sluggard? <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.31. <hi>I went by it, and lo it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the ſtone wall thereof was broken down.</hi> Nothing can be liker then Schiſms to Thorns, and Liberty from Laws to a broken Wall.</p>
                  <p>If I had kept my ſelf to the proper work of the Preacher this day, which is <hi>Palm Sunday,</hi> I ſhould have carried a <hi>Palm</hi> to the triumph of our Saviour entring into <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But finding ſome ſo buſie in ſtrewing our way with THORNS, in ſtead of PALMS, I thought it fitter firſt to clear the way of them, to prepare it
